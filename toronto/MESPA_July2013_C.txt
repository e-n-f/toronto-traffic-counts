1.0        BACKGROUND

1.1        CENTRAL PICKERING DEVELOPMENT PLAN (CPDP)
           The CPDP was intended to become the guide for the road and transit network for the
           implementation of the Seaton Community. The history of this community planning and
           the status of the CPDP as a Provincial plan approved under the authority of the Ontario
           Planning and Development Act means that while the road network can be reviewed and
           evaluated, the CPDP network is to be given primacy.

           The transportation network including the transit component of the CPDP meets the
           objectives, policies and infrastructure requirements to address the internal network
           requirements for the Seaton Study Area. The CPDP also ensures there is adequate
           inter-regional transportation infrastructure. The CPDP transportation network was
           included in the report as Schedule 4 and is shown here as Figure C1.1.

1.2        CITY OF PICKERING OFFICIAL PLAN
           The relevant transportation goals of the City of Pickering Official Plan ensure that
           transportation, land use and community design plans and actions complement each
           other. In order for the Official Plan to conform to the recommendations of the CPDP, the
           City of Pickering Conformity Official Plan Amendment was endorsed by City Council on
           April 26, 2011. The Conformity Official Plan Amendment revised the Type A, B and C
           arterial roads and added a collector road pattern in Seaton as shown on the City of
           Pickering Official Plan Amendment Schedule II - Transportation System. Schedule II
           reflects the proposed arterial and collector roads as outlined in this MESPA. Schedule II
           is provided in Figure C1.2.

1.3        BACKGROUND STUDIES
           In addition to the CPDP and the City of Pickering Conformity Official Plan Amendment,
           there are several background studies that provide planning and design guidance for
           transportation.

           1.3.1 METROLINX: THE BIG MOVE

           The Government of Ontario established the Greater Toronto Transportation Authority in
           2006 (that was subsequently renamed Metrolinx) to create a long-term strategic plan
           integrating the regional transportation system. A Regional Transportation Plan, titled
           “The Big Move: Transforming Transportation in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area
           (GTHA)” was published in November 2008 (a copy can be found at the following link
           www.metrolinx.com/thebigmove/en/default.aspx). The Big Move built on two other
           Provincial reports: the “Greenbelt Plan”, which protects environmentally sensitive and
           agricultural land in the region and the “Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe
           (GGH)”, which manages the population and job growth within the GGH.

           “The Big Move” proposed that GO rail service be expanded into Durham to serve Seaton
           and conceptually identifies a gateway Mobility Hub at the intersection of Brock Road and
           the rail line. ”The Big Move” conceptually identifies service to Peterborough as one of
           many Possible Regional Rail Extensions Beyond the GTHA and suggests as a potential
           longer term project (25+ years) “a new rapid transit service in Durham Region if
           necessary, should the federal government proceed with the proposed Pickering airport.”
           Schedule 1: 15-Year Plan for the Regional Rapid Transit and Highway Network
           conceptually shows the intersection of a number of proposed transit lines at Highway
           407 and Locust Hill. Figure C1.3 shows the original Big Move plan.

           1.3.2 DURHAM-TORONTO-YORK AREA TRANSPORTATION STUDY

           In support of the transportation objectives of the CPDP, the Province undertook the
           Durham-Toronto-York (DTY) Area Transportation Study, (August 31, 2009)
           (www.cityofpickering.com/Seaton/pdfs/DYT_TransportationStudy.pdf), to evaluate long-
           range strategic inter-regional road and transit improvements in these eastern areas of
           Toronto and York Region. Transportation improvements are outlined in the DTY Area
           Transportation Study. The future road improvements are shown in Exhibit 2 and the
           future transit improvements are shown in Exhibit 1 of the DTY Study, shown here as
           Figures C1.4 and C1.5, respectively. The Transit Infrastructure Implementation Plan
           (Table A of the DTY study) and Road Infrastructure Implementation Plan (Table B) are
           appended to this report in Appendix C1.

           In addition to the provincial highways that provide inter-regional linkages, Steeles
           Avenue and 14th Avenue are relevant to Seaton’s transportation needs and are located
           in the City of Toronto and York Region, respectively.

           1.3.2.1           Steeles Avenue East

           Across Toronto, Steeles Avenue serves as a boundary road with York Region but is
           exclusively under City jurisdiction. A 1992 Municipal Engineer’s Association (MEA)
           Class Environmental Assessment (MEA Class EA) study of Steeles Avenue East
           between the Durham boundary and McCowan Road approved a widening to four lanes
           and allowed the City to undertake various improvements along Steeles Avenue. At the
           Durham boundary and across the Rouge Valley, it is generally a two lane road with a
           rural cross-section.

           The Metrolinx publication, “The Big Move”, identified Steeles/Taunton (Project 59),
           between Milliken GO station and downtown Oshawa, as Other Rapid Transit (BRT / LRT
           / AGT) in its Schedule 2: 25-Year Plan for the Regional Rapid Transit and Highway
           Network.”

           1.3.3 DURHAM REGION TRANSPORTATION MASTER PLAN

           The Durham Region Transportation Master Plan, 2005 (TMP) is a strategic planning
           document designed to define the policies, programs and infrastructure improvements
           required to address Durham’s transportation needs for the next 20 years and beyond.
           The TMP reflects the growth and development policies outlined in the City of Pickering
           Official Plan (OP).

Amos Environment + Planning
           Preparation of the TMP followed the Master Planning process defined in the Municipal
           Class EA. The work completed in preparing the TMP is consistent with the first two
           phases of the Class EA planning and design process for the proposed Regional Roads
           projects. Regional arterial roads planned to service Seaton are currently being
           addressed in the CPDP Regional Services Class EA Study.

           The    TMP     (a     copy      can    be     found     at    the     following link
           www.durham.ca/departments/works/roads/TMPNov2005.pdf) detailed three coordinated
           and comprehensive strategies to achieve the Region’s Transportation Vision:

                 •     Provide more travel choices;
                 •     Improving the road system; and,
                 •     Mitigating environmental and community effects.

           1.3.4 DURHAM REGION LONG TERM TRANSIT STRATEGY

           The       Durham      Region      Long       Term       Transit     Strategy     (LTTS)
           (www.durham.ca/default.asp?nr=departments/transit/transit_inside.htm)         is        a
           comprehensive plan that identifies transportation/transit challenges and opportunities in
           Durham Region. The purpose of LTTS is to develop a long term regional transit strategy
           that considers multi-modal transportation alternatives as they relate to, and impact
           transit. The report presents the LTTS in a format that complies with Phase 1 and 2 of
           the five-phase MEA Class EA Study process.

           In Seaton, the LTTS identifies Whites Road (Sideline 26), Rossland Road Extension
           (Sideline 22) and Brock Road as key north-south bus transit routes as well as Highway 7
           and Taunton Road as east-west routes with the latter protecting for future Light Rail
           Transit.

           1.3.5 MESP PHASE 1 (EXISTING CONDITIONS)

           This MESPA should be read in conjunction with the MESP Phase 1 report (March 2008)
           which outlined not only the existing environmental conditions for the Seaton Study Area
           but more particularly reviewed and examined thirty-one (31) potential NHS crossing
           locations as discussed further in Chapter C, Section 6.1.

2.0        MEA CLASS EA REQUIREMENTS
           This MESPA provides specific recommendations for arterial and collector roads within
           Seaton that are under the jurisdiction of the City of Pickering. As noted in Chapter A,
           the MESPA functions as a Master Plan / Class EA Study for the City arterial and
           collector roads. Adhering to the Master Plan provisions of the Municipal Class EA
           (Section A.2.7 and Appendix 4), the Seaton Landowners Group has adopted approach
           #2 to Master Planning. In this approach, the proponent undertakes a Master Plan which
           addresses all the requirements of Phases 1 and 2 of the Municipal Class EA and this is
           documented in a report (i.e. the MESPA). Because the City arterial and collector roads
           are subject to Schedule ‘C’ of the Municipal Class EA, they must in addition, meet the
           requirements of Phases 3 and 4 of the Class EA. The MESPA, as a Master Plan, is not
           open to appeal to the Minister of the Environment for Part II Order requests under the

           Environmental Assessment Act until a Notice of Study Completion for each project is
           issued.

           At the appropriate time, closer to the anticipated date of construction, road projects
           which are subject to Schedule ‘C’ will address the requirements of Phases 3 and 4 of the
           Class EA planning process. Following that study, this process will be documented in a
           Class EA Study known as an Environmental Study Report and a Notice of Study
           Completion for specific projects will be issued.

           The timing of the Phases 3 and 4 Environmental Study Reports for the road projects will
           be established in consultation with the City. City staff will be active stakeholders in the
           Phases 3 and 4 planning process. The conditions of draft plan approval will make the
           completion of the Environmental Study Reports a requirement of the Planning Act
           approvals for the relevant plans of subdivision. It is not necessary to complete the
           Environmental Study Reports prior to development approvals under the Planning Act
           since the completion of these studies will be a condition of draft plan approval.

           The construction of the City arterial and collector roads recommended in this MESPA
           are subject to the provisions of the MEA Class EA as discussed in greater detail in
           Chapter A, Sections 1.0 and 9.0. Depending on the estimated capital cost of the roads
           being planned by the Seaton Landowners Group (SLG), the road may be subject to
           Schedule ‘C’ of the MEA Class EA. For those roads subject to Schedule ‘C’, in order to
           comply with the MEA Class EA planning process, the SLG is undertaking the MEA Class
           EA study in two parts in accordance with the Master Plan provisions of section A.2.7 of
           the Class EA.

           An examination of the City roads proposed in this MESPA (see Figure C6.3) resulted in
           the identification of three road projects which are subject to the requirements of the MEA
           Class EA Schedule ‘C’ 1:

           •     Road IV - East-West Special Type C Arterial ($5.77 million)
           •     Road VI - East-West Employment Collector ($4.5 million)

           Refer to Chapter C, Section 10.0 and Table C10.1 for the capital cost estimates of the
           City arterial and collector roads in accordance with the definition of “cost” in the MEA
           Class EA.

           The other City-jurisdiction arterial and collector roads to be built by the SLG (which are
           designated to be Schedule ‘B’ projects as a result of their estimated cost of less than
           $2.7 million) are not subject to the MEA Class EA per Ontario Regulation 345/93. O.R.
           345/93 designates only projects listed in Schedule C of the Class EA by private sector

 This Class EA Study was initiated using the MEA Class EA, 2000, as amended 2007 with Minister of the
Environment amendments dated March 10, 2010 which adjusted the cost values for municipal road projects.
According to rules set out in the Road Project Cost Limits chart, "the cost threshold in place at the time a project is
initiated shall be the cost threshold used to determine the applicable Schedule and process to be followed throughout
until the completion of the Class EA process". For estimating costs, see also the MEA Class EA glossary. See O.
Reg. 345/93 designating private sector developers of residential development as subject to the Environmental
Assessment Act for Schedule C projects.

           developers as subject to the Environmental Assessment Act; thus, since these road
           projects are subject to Schedule ‘B’, they are not subject to the Municipal Class EA.
           These roads include:

           •     Road II - Type C Arterial (Third Concession Road) between Rossland Road
                 Extension and Whites Road
           •     Road III - North Road
           •     Road V - Collector Road in Northeast Quadrant of Whitevale Road and Rossland
                 Road Extension
           •     Road VII - East-West Collector (South)
           •     Road VIII - Collector Road in Southwest Quadrant of Realigned Whitevale Road and
                 Whites Road
           •     Road IX - North-South Collector (Sideline Road 28)
           •     Road X - Old Brock Collector
           •     Road XI - Mulberry Lane Collector

           While all City roads including the three noted above are addressed fully in this MESPA in
           accordance with Phases 1 and 2 of the MEA Class EA, the three arterial and collector
           roads subject to Schedule ‘C’ must also satisfy Phases 3 and 4 of MEA Class EA prior to
           construction. Subsequent Environmental Study Reports for each Schedule ‘C’ road
           project will be undertaken prior to construction of the road or portions of the road to
           satisfy Phases 3 and 4 MEA Class EA requirements, as outlined in Chapter A.

           The timing for the construction of the City arterial and collector roads which are identified
           in this MESPA were considered in the development of a phasing plan for Seaton called
           the Staged Servicing and Implementation Strategy (SSIS). The proposed SSIS was
           submitted to the City on June 17, 2011 (revised December 2011 and more recently
           revised in October 2012) and provided greater detail about the implementation of the
           arterial and collector roads. The estimated phasing for the arterial and collector roads is
           shown in Appendix C2 (from revised SSIS Figures 2.1 and 2.2).

           The Schedule ‘C’ arterial and collector roads may be further refined via the project-
           specific Environmental Study Reports which will be prepared following the completion of
           the MESPA and prior to road construction.

           Public and agency consultation was carried out for the Seaton Community development
           as a whole and additional opportunities beyond those normally provided under either the
           Planning Act or MEA Class EA, were provided for stakeholders, First Nations, public and
           agencies. As well as opportunities to review the proposed arterial and collector roads,
           the public consultation provided opportunity to review the proposed stormwater
           management plan and recommended community facilities, and to interact with experts at
           the three public meetings. For more information on the consultation undertaken for this
           MESPA, please refer to Chapter H, Public Consultation.

           The Type A and B Arterial roads under the jurisdiction of the Region of Durham are
           being addressed in a separate study entitled “Central Pickering Development Plan
           Regional Services Class EA Study” (CPDP Regional Services Class EA Study). One
           Public Information Centre (PIC) was held for that study on June 16, 2010 and an
           Information Bulletin was issued in January 2011. Please refer to Chapter H for the

           to be completed during the summer of 2013.

2.1        PROBLEM STATEMENT – ARTERIAL AND COLLECTOR ROADS
           As noted in Chapter A, Introduction, the existing transportation system of City roads,
           transit, pedestrian linkages, and pathways will not adequately accommodate the mobility
           needs of future residents and workers within Seaton. New roads and transit service are
           required to serve planned urban growth.

           The Seaton transportation and transit networks were established in the CPDP. The
           CPDP provided objectives, policies and infrastructure requirements to address the
           internal network requirements for the Seaton Study Area. It was designed to safeguard
           the NHS by severely restricting natural heritage system (NHS) crossings and to provide
           adequate transportation infrastructure to serve the new Seaton Community. The CPDP
           transportation network is shown in Figure C1.1.

           To a large extent, the location of the NHS crossing of each arterial and collector road set
           the course for the selection of the arterial and collector road alignments. In the
           requirements for the MESP as established by the CPDP, the MESP was to “confirm the
           overall major transportation system requirements, including bridge locations and open
           space crossings and Neighbourhood traffic calming measures” (CPDP, page 27).

           The Transportation Network policies of the CPDP recognized that new arterials would
           require a MEA Class EA study prior to final design. In this regard, the CPDP specifically
           addressed four matters (CPDP, page 56) to be further considered in a Class EA Study:

                 a) “The appropriate location, structure design and intersection spacing for Third
                    Concession Road westerly extension over the C.P. Rail line and West Duffins
                    Creek” [City arterial];
                 b) “The feasibility from an environmental, engineering and cost perspective of the
                    Sideline Road 24 extension north of Taunton Road to the southerly east-west
                    Collector Road” [City arterial];
                 c) “The location and structure design of the Whites Road to Sideline Road 26
                    connection over West Duffins Creek…” [Regional arterial]; and,
                 d) “The appropriate location, structure design and intersection spacing for the
                    Whitevale Road bypass over the West Duffins Creek” [Regional arterial].

           Items a) and b) above are addressed in Chapter C, Section 6.0. Items c) and d) will be
           fully addressed in the CPDP Regional Services Class EA Study.

3.0        EXISTING AND PLANNED TRANSPORTATION
3.1        EXISTING ROADS
           In the vicinity of Seaton, there are existing Provincial highways and freeways, Regional
           and City roads. The east-west highways and freeways are Highway 7, consisting of a 2-
           lane rural cross-section and 407ETR, a divided toll freeway consisting of two lanes in
           each direction with Brock Road as its current eastern terminus. There are no north-south
           highways.

           Of the Regional roads, Brock Road and Whites Road are north-south and Taunton Road
           is east-west. Other roads are City of Pickering roads, such as Whitevale Road, North
           Road, Third Concession Road (future Regional road – Rossland Road), and Sideline
           Roads 22, 24, 26 and 28. Some sections of the Sideline Roads remain unopened. North
           Road and Sideline Road 24 have overpasses at 407ETR and connect to Highway 7.

           Figure C3.1 shows the existing transportation network.

3.2        PLANNED ROADS
           A combination of Regional and City road projects are planned in and around the Seaton
           Study Area. These are outlined in the following sections. Most of these roads were
           contemplated in the CPDP as shown in Figure C1.1.

           As noted in Section 2.0 of this Chapter, the Region of Durham’s CPDP Regional
           Services Class EA Study will address the Regional Type A and B Arterials within
           Seaton. The Regional roads being addressed include the:

           •     Widening of Brock Road south of Whitevale Road;
           •     Extension of Whites Road (along Sideline Road 26 alignment) to Highway 7;
           •     Widening of Taunton Road;
           •     Extension of Rossland Road to connect with Sideline Road 22;
           •     Realignment of Whitevale Road including the crossing of the West Duffins Creek;
           •     A section of existing Whitevale Road west of Brock Road which will be transferred to
                 Regional jurisdiction; and,
           •     Regional Roads external to the CPDP area to provide an overall Regional roads
                 system within the context of the development of Seaton.

           The remainder of this section addresses the Ministry of Transportation, 407ETR and
           Region of Durham planned roads. City roads are addressed in Chapter C, Sections 6.2
           and 6.3.

           3.2.1 HIGHWAY 407 EXTENSION AND INTERCHANGES

           On June 3, 2010, the Minister of the Environment approved the environmental
           assessment for the 407 East Transportation Corridor (407 East EA) to proceed easterly
           from Brock Road in Pickering to Highway 35/115 in Clarington. A new interchange at
           Brock Road and Highway 407 was approved in the 407 East EA as shown on Figure
           C3.2. This new interchange will require realignment of a section of Brock Road between

           Fifth and Seventh Concession Roads as well as the realignment of Highway 7, and the
           former providing a bypass of the Hamlet of Brougham. The 407 East EA also included a
           proposed transitway with a transitway station to be located in the southwest quadrant of
           this Brock Road interchange. The construction of the Brock Road interchange is
           anticipated to be completed by 2013-2015 which will coincide with the initial phase of
           Seaton development and the Whites Road interchange.

           The EA approval for the existing 407ETR included two interchanges at North Road and
           at Sideline Road 24. That EA approval anticipated an ultimate widening of 407ETR to
           five lanes in each direction, and a separate Transitway abutting the south side.
           Transitway stations were not included in the EA approval.

           The CPDP proposed to retain the existing over-passes at North Road and Sideline Road
           24, and relocate the proposed interchanges to Whites Road (Sideline Road 26) and the
           Rossland Road Extension (Sideline Road 22). Consequently, the owners of 407ETR
           (407 Concessions Company) will prepare an addendum in order to revise the
           interchange locations to correspond with those proposed in the CPCP and this MESPA.
           Discussions with MTO, 407 Concessions Company, Ministry of Natural Resources
           (MNR), Toronto & Region Conservation Authority (TRCA), the Region of Durham, the
           City of Pickering, the SLG and other stakeholders have confirmed the interchange
           locations taking into consideration the extensive natural heritage and cultural information
           that has been collected for the Seaton area. The addendum to the original Highway 407
           EA will be carried out coincident with the CPDP Regional Services Class EA Study.

           The CPDP (and Terms of Reference of the MESP) required that the SLG consider the
           timing of the two 407ETR interchanges from the perspective of the Seaton Study Area
           and Seaton development requirements. A summary of the factors that were addressed
           in consideration of the phasing of the interchanges is provided in Table C3.1.

           Based on the considered factors, it is recommended that the Whites Road interchange
           at 407ETR be the first Seaton interchange to be constructed.

           3.2.2 HIGHWAY 7 WIDENING

           Currently, Highway 7 east of Brock Road to Highway 12 (Baldwin Street in Whitby) is
           undergoing widening from 2 lanes to 4 lanes. It was anticipated that Highway 7 would
           be transferred to the Region’s jurisdiction upon opening of the Highway 407 East
           extension (originally scheduled in 2014). Highway 407 East is subject to phased
           construction, with the section to Harmony Road, Oshawa expected to be opened in late
           2015 and the final section to Highway 115/35 completed in 2020. Currently, it is
           uncertain as to when the jurisdiction will be transferred.

           MTO has completed an EA Study for Highway 7 between the Markham By-pass and
           Brock Road for minor improvements to this section, however does not include studying
           the provision of widening. In the DTY study, Highway 7 is proposed to be widened from
           2 lanes to ultimately 6 lanes (including HOV lanes) between Markham By-pass and
           Brock Road. Expediting the transfer of jurisdiction of Highway 7, at a minimum, between
           York Durham Line and Brock Road, would permit:

           a) The Region to proceed with a Class EA to confirm the right-of-way and other
              requirements associated with its ultimate design configuration, and
           b) Application of the Region’s planning and design standards which are less restrictive
              than MTO’s and maximize the employment potential.

Amos Environment + Planning
           Following the transfer of Highway 7 to Durham Region, this road would be a Regional
           Type A arterial.

           The EA Study for the widening of Highway 7 should re-assess the need for the widening
           to 6 lanes (including HOV lanes) since there is limited ridership potential between
           Markham By-pass and the York Durham Line and inter-regional bus service can be
           provided on 407ETR. This will initially operate in mixed traffic and ultimately on the
           proposed 407 Transitway. Moreover, adequate transit service to the employment lands
           can be provided by Durham Region Transit (DRT) routes in Seaton which will interface
           with the GO bus routes along 407ETR and 407 East at the 407 Transitway stations.

           The latest traffic enumeration show that traffic volumes on Highway 7 in recent years
           have remained stable and that there is residual capacity available. Consequently,
           widening of Highway 7 is not necessary for Phase 1 of the Seaton development.

           3.2.3 REALIGNMENT OF BROCK ROAD AND HIGHWAY 7 AT
                 HIGHWAY 407

           In the vicinity of the Hamlet of Brougham, Brock Road and Highway 7 will be realigned to
           accommodate the new Brock Road Interchange at the proposed Highway 407 East. The
           realignments will be constructed by MTO to coincide with the completion of the Brock
           Road – 407 East interchange which is anticipated to be operational by 2015.

           In the vicinity of Seventh Concession Road, Brock Road is planned to continue along its
           existing alignment. It is anticipated that Brock Road will provide access to the proposed
           Pickering Airport, predominately for freight and air side activities.

           These road section realignments were included in the approved 407 East Transportation
           Corridor EA (undertaken by MTO).

           3.2.4 REALIGNED WHITEVALE ROAD

           For traffic to by-pass the historic Hamlet of Whitevale, a new road was proposed in the
           CPDP. This Type B arterial would travel from the existing Whitevale Road in the vicinity
           of Sideline Road 22 and follow a south-westerly alignment to ultimately connect to 14th
           Avenue at the Town of Markham. This new Region of Durham arterial road was
           included in the Durham-Toronto-York Area Transportation Study and the Durham
           section is included in the CPDP Regional Services Class EA Study. This proposed new
           road is referred to as the “Realigned Whitevale Road” in this document.

           Through analyses completed as part of the Staged Servicing and Implementation Study
           (SSIS), October 2012 it was determined that the need for the crossing of the West
           Duffins Creek by the Realigned Whitevale Road will be in the subsequent stages of
           development. If this occurs, measures by the Region of Durham would be needed to
           protect the existing Hamlet of Whitevale from extraneous traffic infiltration. These
           measures are discussed in the SSIS as follows:

           “Potential alternatives to direct traffic away from the Hamlet of Whitevale include one or
           more of the following:

Amos Environment + Planning
           a)          Remove the existing west-leg of Whitevale Road at Whites Road and a section of
                       Whitevale Road east of Golf Club Road;
           b)          Reconfigure the intersection at existing Whitevale Road and Altona Road,
                       perhaps installing a roundabout; and
           c)          Implement one-way traffic along Whitevale Road at the west (westbound) and
                       east (eastbound) links out of the Hamlet of Whitevale. For inbound traffic into the
                       Hamlet of Whitevale, residents would use North Road and a section of Golf Club
                       Road.”

           In addition, as part of the discussions between the City and the Seaton Landowner
           Group relating to certain City financial matters, it has been proposed that the City will
           undertake a separate Whitevale Traffic Management Study that will address traffic
           impacts as Seaton develops on the Hamlet of Whitevale.

           3.2.5 WHITES ROAD - SIDELINE ROAD 26

           Currently, Whites Road intersects with Taunton Road on the west bank of the West
           Duffins Creek. According to the CPDP, Whites Road is proposed to be realigned and a
           bridge added over the Creek to connect Whites Road with Sideline Road 26 at Taunton
           Road.

           At 407ETR, Sideline Road 26 (Whites Road) is planned to have a full interchange.
           North of Highway 7, the Greater Toronto Airport Authority (GTAA) proposed that Whites
           Road connect into the proposed Pickering Airport lands and provide access to a future
           passenger terminal.

           The northerly extension of Whites Road, including a new crossing of West Duffins
           Creek, is being addressed in the CPDP Regional Services Class EA Study. That study is
           also considering the construction of Whites Road from Taunton Road to Highway 7 as
           an ultimate 6-lane cross-section with High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) curb lanes. This
           segment is needed in Seaton since this north-south road forms the backbone of the
           community for servicing and transit opportunities and will provide access to 407ETR. For
           Phase 1 of Seaton it is proposed that Whites Road will be constructed to its ultimate six
           (6) lane urban configuration from Taunton Road to Whitevale Road except where it
           crosses the NHS and as a four (4) lane rural cross-section road from Whitevale to
           Highway 7. Where Whites Road crosses the NHS between Taunton Road and
           Whitevale Road, consideration will be given to a rural or modified urban cross-section
           provided that the required surface and subsurface infrastructure and transition lengths
           are considered and are appropriate.
           CPDP Regional Services Class EA Study includes the Whites Road widening southerly
           to Finch Avenue.

           3.2.6 EXTENSION OF ROSSLAND ROAD TO SIDELINE ROAD 22

           Currently, Third Concession Road (the extension of Rossland Road west of Brock Road)
           terminates at a cul-de-sac at the former Brock Road Land Transfer Station facility west
           of Valley Farm Road. The CPDP proposes that Rossland Road Extension will extend
           westerly along the existing Third Concession Road and northerly over the CP Rail
           adjacent to the West Duffins Creek and generally follow the existing road allowance of

           Sideline Road 22 to an interchange at 407ETR, and end at a ‘T’ intersection at Highway
           7 including a grade separation at the CPR right of way south of the first phase of Seaton.

           This road is being addressed in the CPDP Regional Services Class EA Study.

           3.2.7 14th AVENUE

           CPDP and the DTY Study proposed that the Realigned Whitevale Road would connect
           to 14th Avenue at the York Durham Line. The SSIS, October 2012 concluded
           development of Seaton only requires that Whitevale Bypass be extended to Altona
           Road. Possible future extension of the Whitevale Bypass to connect to 14th Avenue may
           be necessary in the future depending on future traffic growth travel demand patterns.

           Class EA studies for the widening of 14th Avenue by York Region are tentatively
           scheduled for 2016 and 2018 for the sections from Ninth Line to Reesor Road and
           Reesor Road to York Durham Line, respectively.

3.3        EXISTING AND PLANNED TRANSIT
           3.3.1 GO BUS

           GO Transit currently operates buses on 407ETR in mixed traffic and eventually plans to
           run them on the separate 407 Transitway along the south side of Highway 407. With
           development of Seaton and construction of the interchanges at Brock Road and Whites
           Road, GO buses will exit the Highway 407 to stop at the combined parking lots and
           carpooling / kiss n ride facilities including transfers to Durham Region Transit (DRT) bus
           routes. This interim condition is referred to as a “transit station”.

           The transit station at Brock Road was approved in the 407 East Extension EA study. A
           transit station at Whites Road will require EA approval. With the environmental and
           cultural constraints in the vicinity of the proposed Transitway stations at Brock Road,
           Whites Road and also Rossland Road Extension, it may be necessary to advance
           construction of a transit station at York Durham Line (Figure C1.1) in order to serve later
           phases of the Seaton development.

           Further EA studies for both the Whites Road and York Durham Line transit stations
           should be undertaken by Metrolinx and GO Transit in accordance with the EA Act for
           transit projects.

           3.3.2 GO RAIL

           “The Big Move” prepared by Metrolinx identified potential use of the CPR Belleville
           Subdivision and CPR Havelock Subdivision for new passenger GO service passing near
           the Seaton Community to connect with GO stations in Toronto.

           The CPDP proposed a GO station on the south side of Taunton Road west of Brock
           Road. As part of this MESPA, an analysis for the preferred location of the GO station
           was undertaken (refer to Chapter C, Section 7.2).

           3.3.3 ARTERIAL HIGHER-ORDER TRANSIT

           As part of the CPDP Regional Services Class EA Study, higher order transit on Whites,
           Brock, and Taunton Roads is being examined. The Long Term Transit Study (LTTS) for
           Durham Region recommended Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) service along Whites Road
           (Sideline Road 26) north of Bayly Street, along Brock Road between Bayly Street and
           Highway 7, and along Taunton Road between Whites Road and York Durham Line with
           extensions into Toronto. These BRT services would operate at high frequency and
           ultimately envisions bus-only median lanes. The LTTS also recommended Light Rail
           Transit (LRT) along Taunton Road between Whites Road and Simcoe Street in Oshawa.

3.4        PLANNED FEDERAL PICKERING AIRPORT
           The Federal government has set aside portions of their lands north of Highway 7 and
           west of Brock Road for a potential future airport uses.

           On July 11, 2011, Transport Canada released the findings of the 2010 Pickering Lands
           Needs Assessment Study (http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/ontario/pickeringstudy.htm).

           According to Transport Canada, “the study was conducted to broaden and update
           previous work on the role and capacity of airports in the Greater Golden Horseshoe area
           in meeting future needs for passenger, cargo and recreational traffic within a 25-year
           horizon. The Government of Canada has noted that the study determined that an
           additional airport will be required in the Greater Golden Horseshoe area in the future and
           that the Pickering Lands would be a prime location for a new airport.” The report
           recommends the Pickering Airport will be required in the Greater Golden Horseshoe
           Area between 2027 and 2037. This MESPA has included planning for transportation
           and other servicing infrastructure for the future airport.

           The most recent data shows that there has been no growth in the westbound direction
           during the morning peak (commuter traffic) on Highway 7. In contrast, the corresponding
           traffic on 407ETR has seen growth over the last 5 years on an average of almost 10%

           From the data, trends show that transit modal split remains consistently low at 5%;
           however, trip lengths over time show a decreasing trend. This trend indicates that the
           population in Pickering is finding employment closer to home and not relying on long
           commutes into Toronto. There appears to be a constant (6%) proportion of trips that are
           representative of commuters who continue to use the GO train service into Toronto.

           From the trip distribution data for trip purposes and modes (Table C4.4), it is worth
           noting that all trips from Pickering to the rest of Durham have increased from 48% to
           54% (2001 to 2006) and decreased to Toronto from 42% to 36%, indicating that people
           in Pickering are choosing to make commuter trips locally, within shorter distances.

4.3        FORECASTS
           In the north-south direction, growth is expected along the proposed new links (Rossland
           Road, Whites Road and North Road Extension); however, some of these routes will not
           be continuous due to the proposed Pickering Airport lands, NHS and valley crossings
           and there are few attractions for traffic to and from the north.

           The widening of Highway 7 east of Brock Road and the easterly extension of Highway
           407 in 2017 will significantly alter travel patterns. It is expected that traffic volumes
           along existing east-west routes, such as Taunton Road will initially decrease as traffic
           diverts to Highway 407 East extension and the widened Highway 7. In addition, Brock
           Road traffic between Highway 407 and Rossland Road will reduce initially as traffic to
           and from the east will continue along Highway 407 East and the widened Highway 7.
           The traffic operating parameters at the Brock intersections (at Taunton Road and at
           Rossland Road) will show significant improvement due to these diversions.

           Extrapolating recent TTS trends (Table C4.4), it is relevant to note that significantly more
           than half of trips generated by Seaton will travel within Durham. During the commuter
           peak periods, Seaton residents will travel in the off-peak direction (eastbound in the
           morning and westbound in the evening). The arterial road network will have adequate
           capacity with minimal impacts to operational levels of service to accommodate this
           traffic.

5.0        EVALUATION CRITERIA FOR ROAD ALTERNATIVES
           The CPDP identified preferred alignments and designations for arterial and collector
           roads to serve Seaton and specified the general locations for NHS crossings. The CPDP
           road alignments and designations form the basis for all road projects being addressed in
           this MESPA. As part of fulfilling Phase 1 and 2 of the MEA Class EA, alternatives to the
           CPDP alignments and designations have been investigated and evaluated. It should be
           noted that given the history of and the previous approvals granted to the CPDP, an
           examination of the traditional ‘Do Nothing’ alternative was not applicable and was not
           undertaken.

           This MESPA considered various alternative road alignment and NHS crossing locations
           to those approved in the CPDP. This evaluation was based on the updated information
           found in MESP Phase 1 Report (2008) and completed by the MESPA Study Team since
           then including NHS and cultural heritage information. The goal of the evaluation of

           alternatives was to minimize potential impacts to natural and cultural resources and to
           implement the Seaton Community as approved in the CPDP.

           Road designations were identified in the Region of Durham Official Plan and the CPDP.
           In this MESPA, alternative road designations were considered in order to reduce
           potential impacts to natural and cultural resources. Road traffic levels and cross-section
           widths have potential to widen corridors through the NHS and increase potential for
           wildlife disruption. The data trends pertaining to the population of Pickering, the location
           and use patterns of the roads by existing community and input from the PICs were
           considered. As a result of the examination of road designations and anticipated traffic
           flows, minor changes to designations and alternative road design standards were
           recommended. The result of these changes will be to minimize right-of-way widths and
           resulting impacts to the NHS. It is important to note that the recommended revisions to
           the road designations will not negatively affect the proposed road network identified in
           the CPDP.

           The CPDP also identified a transit network on Schedule 4 of the CPDP (refer to Figure
           C1.1). Alternatives to the CPDP transit network have been investigated and evaluated
           as part of this MESPA.

           The CPDP mandated the consideration of alternative transportation choices including
           improvements and/or expansion to the transit system. Such improvements would reduce
           reliance on automobiles and thereby reduce environmental impacts. The proposed
           Seaton transit system identified potential improvements that could offer additional trip
           choices for residents to meet this objective. New collector roads were recommended to
           provide bus transit services to development areas. Bus routing systems will ensure that
           the CPDP requirement of 400m walking distance to transit will be implemented.
           Enhanced transit system recommendations include consideration of future GO Transit
           facilities.

           Table C5.1 presents an overview of the evaluation criteria used to assess the Seaton
           arterial and collector road alternatives. Details on the planned Seaton road and transit
           network alternatives are presented in Chapter C, Sections 6.0 and 7.0, respectively.
           Details on the Active Transportation system are provided in Chapter C, Section 8.0.

6.0        PLANNED SEATON ROAD NETWORK
           As outlined in Chapter C, Section 5.0, the CPDP identified alignments and designations
           for arterial and collector roads to serve Seaton including the locations for NHS crossings.
           Alternatives to the CPDP alignments, designations and NHS crossing locations have
           been investigated and evaluated as part of this MESPA to fulfill the requirements of
           Phase 1 and 2 of the MEA Class EA as outlined in the following sections.

6.1        ROAD CROSSINGS OF THE NHS
           As noted in Chapter C, Section 1.1, the CPDP established the need for and location of
           the arterial and collector roads required to implement the Seaton Community. Key
           considerations in the many studies culminating in the approval of the CPDP, related to
           the protection of the NHS lands. This protection was achieved by prohibiting
           development in the NHS lands and by minimizing the number of crossings of the NHS,
           as presented below in an excerpt of the CPDP policies.

           Section 4.6 Servicing, Policy 9, of the CPDP provides the following direction with respect
           to finalizing the locations of the NHS crossings:

                 9. Consider the following principles during the planning and design of
                    transportation and public utilities corridors, recognizing that new crossings
                    of the Natural Heritage System are required to meet the transportation and
                    infrastructure needs of the new community:
                    (a) Avoid road and public utility crossings of the Natural Heritage System,
                        wherever possible;
                    (b) Co-locate unavoidable crossings of the Natural Heritage System with
                        other road or public utility crossings;
                    (c) Where roads and public utilities must cross the Natural Heritage
                        System where there is no existing crossing, locate the corridor within
                        agricultural lands, meadows or successional communities;
                    (d) Locate corridors through significant natural features only where it is
                        demonstrated that no reasonable alternative exists;
                    (e) Where intrusions into significant natural features do occur, make all
                        reasonable attempts to minimize the intrusions and their impacts and
                        to locate such intrusions along peripheral areas of features to avoid
                        fragmentation of the Natural Heritage System;
                    (f) Cross valleys at their narrowest points, wherever possible;
                    (g) Where culverts are used, utilize oversized box culverts placed below
                        grade to provide aquatic and terrestrial linkages;

                       (h) Ensure that the types of crossing structures as determined by the
                           Master Environmental Servicing Plan maximize the preservation of
                           natural habitat and permit natural movement; and
                       (i) Convey surface runoff to adjacent tablelands and not discharge from
                           structures to the valley lands below.”

           In order to comply with the policies of the CPDP, the consideration of alternatives to
           CPDP road alignments in this MESPA was limited to the identification of variations to the
           preferred road alignment identified in the CPDP and there was no consideration of a
           traditional Do Nothing alternative since the Do Nothing alternative would be contrary to
           the policies of the CPDP and could not support the Seaton development.

           In the MESP Phase 1 Report (Existing Conditions, March 2008), the natural heritage
           conditions of thirty-one (31) road crossings were documented. These comprised 16
           crossings of NHS for upgrades/extensions of Regional roads and 15 crossings of NHS
           for upgrades/extensions of existing and additional roads in support of future
           development. The locations of the crossings are illustrated on Figure C6.1, Crossings of
           the NHS. The crossings associated with the Regional roads are identified with a ‘letter’
           (e.g. ‘A’) and those associated with City roads are identified with a ‘number’ (e.g. ‘1’).
           The categorization as ‘regional’ or ‘city’ road reflected the direction in the CPDP.

           As a result of the findings of the MESP Phase 1 Report, 6 additional NHS crossing
           locations were identified for new City roads. These locations also are illustrated on
           Figure C6.1. These additional crossings are labelled as Crossings 16 through 21,
           inclusive. An additional 10 NHS crossings by City roads (Crossings 23 to 32) have been
           identified in the Neighbourhood Plans and are also shown on Figure C6.2. Eight of
           these latter crossings (Crossings 23 to 30) are on local roads in employment lands
           abutting the 407ETR and the alignments are subject to change to comply with
           intersection spacing standards required by MTO and Durham Region. Crossing 31 was
           added to provide secondary (emergency) access between two development areas in
           Neighbourhood 17; and Crossing 32 (comprising a number of small sub-units, 32-i
           through 32-v), also in Neighbourhood 17, was added to comply with Region of Durham
           requirements regarding access to the Taunton and Brock Regional roads. These
           crossings were added, as part of the Neighbourhood Planning process undertaken by
           the City of Pickering and adopted through OPA 22, subsequent to the completion of
           roads investigations by the MESPA. As part of the NFSSR for Neighbourhood 17, these
           two crossings (#31 and #32) will be reviewed and evaluated to the same level of detail
           as occurred for the other City of Pickering roads as per Section C6.2, below, and
           Appendix C6-A.

           The figures documenting the natural heritage conditions for Crossings 16 to 21, using
           the same method and format as the thirty-one (31) crossings included in the MESP
           Phase 1 report, are included in Appendix C6-A.

           The natural heritage conditions of all crossings are summarized in Table 1 of Appendix
           C6-A.

6.2        REVIEW AND EVALUATION OF ALTERNATIVE ROAD
           ALIGNMENTS
           The City of Pickering roads, as identified in the CPDP, were considered in this MESPA.
           As outlined in Chapter C, Section 5.0, alternatives to the CPDP road alignments have
           been investigated to fulfill the requirements of Phase 1 and 2 of the MEA Class EA. As
           a result of the evaluation of alternatives, minor changes to the CPDP road alignments
           have been made to minimize the effects to environmental, social, economic, cultural and
           heritage sensitive areas.

           Tables C6.1 to C6.11 below present the evaluation matrices for each road which were
           utilized to determine the preferred alignments. A brief summary of the evaluation is
           provided for each road followed by the corresponding matrix. Figure C6.3 shows the
           recommended revisions to the Type C Arterial and Collector road alignments compared
           to the CPDP road alignments. It should be noted that potential impacts of the proposed
           crossings of the NHS will be mitigated by the greatest degree possible provided that the
           proposed mitigation measures are adopted and implemented as outlined in Table C11.1
           in Chapter C, Section 11.0.

           Road I: North-South Type C Arterial (Sideline Road 24) (see Table C6.1)

           The segment of this arterial road between Taunton Road and the East-West Collector
           (Road VII) is required from a transportation network connectivity perspective in order to
           provide development traffic and transit service to a high school and community park
           proposed to the north of Road VII and a community node proposed to the south at
           Taunton Road.

           The alignment has been modified from the CPDP to avoid a significant wetland north of
           Taunton Road. The proposed alignment passes to the east side of the feature.

           NHS crossings #11 and #12 as described in the Phase 1 MESP Existing Conditions
           report Appendix E, Figures 5A.27 and 5A.28, and in Table 1 of Appendix C6-A, and
           shown on Figure C6.2, are considered acceptable with the proposed mitigation
           measures adopted as outlined in Table C11.1 in Chapter C, Section 11.0.

            Recommendation: Revise Type C Arterial alignment as shown on Figure C6.3.

           Road II: Type C Arterial (Third Concession Road) (between Rossland Road
           Extension and Whites Road) (see Table C6.2)

           The CPDP proposed a Type C arterial generally parallel to and north of Third
           Concession Road between the Rossland Road Extension and Whites Road. There have
           been detailed discussions with the TRCA regarding their concerns on the need for an
           additional crossing of the West Duffins Creek and the potential environmental impacts.

           The MESPA concludes that this road section be deleted for the following reasons.

           •     No demonstrated traffic demand;
           •     No road network connecting to the west, particularly into Toronto;
           •     No transit benefit or need;
           •     Requires additional crossing of West Duffins Creek which has significant adverse
                 environmental impacts;
           •     Road is aligned through NHS and therefore there will be no development requiring
                 access or transit service; and,
           •     Access is available and adequate for the properties fronting onto existing Third
                 Concession Road.

           Recommendation: For reasons presented in Table C6.2, this East-West Arterial is being
           removed from further consideration.

           Road II continues to be listed in the consideration of alternative arterial and collector
           roads because it was identified as part of the arterial and collector road network in the
           CPDP. Figure C6.3 shows the original CPDP road network as well as the arterial and
           collector roads proposed as a result of the MESPA evaluation. Road II has remained
           part of the overall evaluation of the Seaton arterial and collector roads in order to comply
           with the MESP Terms of Reference, to confirm the reasons for its removal, and to
           provide complete documentation.

           Road III: North Road Type C Arterial (see Table C6.3)

           To accommodate the intersection of this road (which has an overpass at 407ETR) with
           Road IV, minor alignment modifications are required.

           At the proposed intersection of the existing North Road and Road IV, a roundabout is
           proposed to define an entry into the Hamlet of Whitevale and deter traffic infiltration.
           Combined with the realignment with Road IV, it provides more efficient development as
           well as improved transit coverage.

           NHS Crossing 10 as described in Phase 1 MESP Existing Conditions report Appendix E,
           Figure 5A.26, and in Table 1 of Appendix C6-A, and shown on Figure C6.1, is
           considered acceptable with the proposed mitigation measures.

           Recommendation: Revise Type C Arterial alignment as shown on Figure C6.3.

           Road IV: East-West Special Type C Arterial (between North Road and Rossland
           Road Extension (see Tables C6.4 and C6.5)

           This segment of the CPDP Arterial remains designated as a Type C Arterial from North
           Road to Rossland Road Extension. This road is Special Type C Arterial to provide
           reduced right-of-way width; provide parking bays where appropriate; provide flexible
           frontage and access controls; provide intersection spacing options and encourage on-
           street and pedestrian activity. Minor modifications to the alignment are proposed to
           accommodate the intersections with North Road and with Road IX - North-South
           Collector (Sideline Road 28).

           NHS crossings #2 to #4 and #9 as described in Phase 1 MESP Existing Conditions
           report Appendix E Figures 5A.18, 5A.19, 5A.20, and 5A.25, and in Table 1 of Appendix
           C6-A, and shown on Figure C6.2, are considered acceptable with the proposed
           mitigation measures.

           Recommendation: Adopt Special Type C designation and revise alignment as shown on
           Figure C6.3.

           Road V: Collector Road in Northeast Quadrant of Whitevale Road and Rossland
           Road Extension (CPDP East-West Type C Arterial) (see Tables C6.4 and C6.5)

           The proposed alignment generally follows the CPDP; however, the road classification is
           proposed to be down-graded to a collector to create options for access; intersection
           spacing and a 90o bend to better accommodate the residential development. Road
           network continuity is not required and transit routes and service levels are not affected.

           NHS crossing #1 as described in Phase 1 MESP Existing Conditions report Appendix E,
           Figure 5A.17, and in Table 1 of Appendix C6-A, and shown on Figure C6.2, is
           considered acceptable with the proposed mitigation.

           Recommendation: Revise Type C Arterial to a Collector designation and adopt the
           alignment as shown on Figure C6.3.

           Road VI: Employment Collector (see Table C6.6)

           This collector road alignment was improved by minimizing the potential for
           environmental (NHS, wetland and forest) and cultural impacts while improving
           intersection spacing at the approaches to the proposed 407ETR interchange ramps.
           The single-loaded development frontage was reduced and the overall road length was
           reduced to 3.75 km with anticipated lower construction costs. The alignment of the
           collector west of Whites Road was determined partially by location of the Whites Road
           Transitway station on lands by MTO and the existing environmental area, as well as the
           limits of the NHS. The alignment west of the Rossland Road Extension was selected
           due to the discovery of a culturally significant archaeological site and environmentally
           sensitive features, including woodlands and wetlands.

           The intersection of Road VI with North Road also was relocated north of the CPDP
           location for two reasons: to bring the alignment out of and away from the NHS and
           provide potential for double-loaded development lots. The existing local road on the
           west side of North Road can be realigned opposite the collector.

           NHS crossings #16 to #21 as described in Appendix C6-A (Figures 1 to 5 and Table 1)
           and shown on Figure C6.2, are considered acceptable with the proposed mitigation
           measures.

           Recommendation: Revise collector alignment as shown on Figure C6.3.

           Minor road alignment modifications to the proposed CPDP alignment are proposed for
           more efficient development layout. There are no negative environmental impacts
           anticipated as a result of the alignment changes.

           NHS crossings #13 and #14 as described in Phase 1 MESP Existing Conditions report
           Appendix E, Figures 5A.29 and 5A.30, and in Table 1 of Appendix C6-A, and shown on
           Figure C6.2, are considered acceptable with the proposed mitigation measures.

           Recommendation: Revise collector alignment as shown on Figure C6.3.

           Road VIII: Collector Road in Southwest Quadrant of Realigned Whitevale Road
           and Whites Road (see Table C6.8)

           This road alignment generally follows the proposed CPDP alignment with minor
           modifications for efficient residential development blocks. This collector will also serve
           as a bus route to meet the transit coverage requirement.

           NHS crossing #15 as described in Phase 1 MESP Existing Conditions report Appendix
           E, Figure 5A.31, and in Table 1 of Appendix C6-A (for crossings #15a and #15b), and
           shown on Figure C6.2 (for crossings #15a and #15b), is considered acceptable with the
           proposed mitigation.

           Recommendation: Revise collector alignment as shown on Figure C6.3.

           Road IX: North-South Collector (Sideline Road 28) (see Table C6.9)

           Road modifications to the CPDP alignment are proposed to permit more efficient layout
           of development blocks. The alignment follows the Sideline Road 28 (unopened) road
           allowance and accommodates the intersection with Road IV - East-West Special Type C
           Arterial. The modified alignment provides improved transit coverage.

           There are no NHS crossings identified.

           Recommendation: Revise collector alignment as shown on Figure C6.3.

           Road X: Old Brock Collector (see Table C6.10)

           This is a new collector that was not originally identified in the CPDP. This collector
           would be built on a section of the existing Brock Road which will be taken out of use
           when the realigned Brock Road is constructed. The new collector (Old Brock Collector)
           would have two intersections to the realigned Brock Road to comply with the CPDP
           requirements for transit service coverage to the employment lands abutting the 407ETR.
           The new collector allows for a looping of transit vehicles and thus avoids dead heading
           transit routes while enhancing access for emergency vehicles.

           There are no NHS crossings identified.

           Recommendation: Adopt the new collector alignment as shown on Figure C6.3.

           Road XI: Mulberry Lane Collector (see Table C6.11)

           This is a new collector that was not originally identified in the CPDP. This collector is
           required to provide transit service to the residential development area in the vicinity of
           Mulberry Lane which is located west of Brock Road and south of existing Whitevale
           Road. The alignment requires widening of the Mulberry Lane road allowance along the
           eastern boundary and cannot be widened to the west due to cultural heritage
           constraints. A portion of Mulberry Lane will have a pavement width of 12m to satisfy
           emergency access.

           An additional potential future connection to Whitevale Road was added as part of the
           Neighbourhood Planning process undertaken by the City of Pickering and adopted
           through OPA 22. It crosses the NHS, identified as crossing #22 on Figure C6.2 and
           described in Appendix C6-A (Figure 6 and Table 1). This NHS crossing is considered
           acceptable with the proposed mitigation measures.

           Recommendation: Adopt the new collector alignments as shown on Figure C6.3.

           6.2.1 SPECIES AT RISK

           Species at Risk which have been identified in the Seaton Study Area and are regulated
           by the Ontario Endangered Species Act and the federal Species at Risk Act, include:
           Redside Dace, Bobolink, Least Bittern and Butternut. As well Atlantic Salmon, although
           classified as ‘extinct’ by COSSARO, MNR is implementing an Atlantic Salmon long-term
           restoration program.

           Findings of this investigation and the implications of those findings are discussed more
           fully in Chapter E and summarized here:

           •     Redside Dace and Bobolink will be addressed through Overall Benefit Permits per
                 Section 17 of the Endangered Species Act and/or provisions of Ontario Regulation
                 293/11 as applicable;
           •     Atlantic Salmon will be addressed by Redside Dace Permits where required where
                 in-water work is required in a Redside Dace occupied or recovery reach of
                 Ganatsekiagon Creek, but will require its own permit for West Duffins Creek (and is
                 not an issue for other creeks);
           •     The known location of Least Bittern has no implications to development in Seaton;
                 and,
           •     For the road alignments that were shown in the CPDP, a 100m swath centred on all
                 of the road alignment locations was inventoried and those alignments were
                 determined to be free of Butternut trees.

           Therefore, for all alignments that were not within 100m of the centre-line of the CPDP
           alignments, additional inventory work will be required to identify whether Butternut trees
           are located where they could be harmed or destroyed. If the species is present, it will be
           addressed as outlined in Table C6.13 and further discussed in Chapter E.

           In the future, either at the time of the preparation of the Phases 3 and 4 MEA Class EA
           studies for these City roads and for other roads not subject to Phases 3 and 4 of the
           Class EA process, at final design, ‘Species Lists’ under the provincial Endangered
           Species Act and the federal Species at Risk Act will be reviewed to determine if study
           updates are required.

           The review and evaluation of alignment modifications as presented above in Chapter C,
           Section 6.2 has resulted in the following recommendations with regard to Endangered
           Species.

           1. Site specific mitigation will be incorporated into the design of NHS crossings, as
              discussed in Chapter C Sections 6.4.2 and 11.0 below. No terrestrial compensation
              is envisaged where these road crossings of the NHS were established by the CPDP;
              however, if additional road crossings are added, or if the road location is moved to a
              location where greater impacts to the NHS would occur, then compensation would
              be required. The compensation would be as discussed in Chapter C Section 11.0,
              Table C11.1, and comprises naturalization of suitable areas of NHS lands to
              appropriate habitat. Moreover, the implications of additional crossings of Redside
              Dace habitat and the Overall Benefit Plan or Mitigation Plan for this species (see
              Chapter E) will have to be addressed.

           2. For all stream crossings, where there is potential for harmful alteration, disruption or
              destruction or disturbance (HADD) at stream crossings, under the Federal Fisheries
              Act, a framework for fisheries compensation has been provided in Chapter F, and
              may be in addition to any requirements associated with Redside Dace Overall
              Benefit Plan or Mitigation Plan for those tributaries for which the Overall Benefit Plan
              is applicable.

6.3        REVIEW AND EVALUATION OF ALTERNATIVE ROAD
           DESIGNATIONS
           As outlined in Chapter C, Section 5.0, alternatives to the CPDP road designations have
           been investigated and evaluated to fulfill the requirements of Phase 1 and 2 of the MEA
           Class EA. As a result of the evaluation of alternatives, minor changes to the CPDP road
           designations have been made. Table C6.12 summarizes the results of the CPDP road
           designation evaluations.

6.4        CITY ROAD AND CROSSING DESIGN STANDARDS
           Based on the review of CPDP road alignments and designations, the MESPA
           recommends that the following design standards and considerations be applied for roads
           and crossings of the NHS.

           6.4.1 ROAD DESIGN STANDARDS

           6.4.1.1          Type C Arterial

           The right-of-way shall be kept to a minimum and shall not exceed a maximum of 30m,
           and more typically have a right-of-way of 24m (as stated in Section 11.29 of the OP
           Conformity document and agreed to by the SLG). The exception is at the approaches to
           major intersections where medians and/or additional lanes are required. Similarly, the
           pavement width typically shall be 15m (four basic lanes during peak periods; two lanes
           per direction) (see Figure in Appendix C6-B); however, can be wider to accommodate
           turning lanes, bike lanes, parking, and bus lay-bys.

           In accordance with CPDP policies, bike paths and/or bike lanes will be provided, and
           where possible, with 3m wide multi-use paths within the boulevard on each side.

           6.4.1.2          Special Type C Arterial

           For the Special Type C Arterial (Road IV), the City will be considering modified
           standards for right-of-way width including two travel lanes with left turn lanes at
           intersections, on-road bicycle lanes on each side, reduced intersection spacing,
           provision for parking bays where appropriate and flexible frontage and access controls.

           6.4.1.3          Collector

           The right-of-way shall be kept to a minimum and shall not exceed a maximum of 23m,
           and more typically have a right-of-way of 20m, except at the approaches to major
           intersections where medians and/or additional lanes are required. The Collector roads
           in residential areas will consist of two travelled lanes with on-road bike lanes on both
           sides and parking lay-bys along one side. Parking will not be permitted along Collectors
           in employment areas to promote an efficient flow of transit and truck movements,
           however on-road bike lanes or shared on-road bike facilities on both sides may be
           provided for linkage.

           6.4.1.4          General Standards

           As part of the Environmental Servicing Plan (ESP) for Duffin Heights, the City of
           Pickering approved reduced right-of-way widths and these reductions have been
           accepted for use by the Region of Durham and local utility providers. This MESPA
           recommends that these standards be used within Seaton.

           Roads crossing the NHS will have a rural cross-section, wherever possible; that is no
           curbs and gutters. “It is desirable to coordinate the NHS crossings design with the

Amos Environment + Planning
           Regional arterials and there needs to be consultation between the City and the CPDP
           Regional Services Class EA Study team to reach a consensus on the design.”

           These cross-sections are provided in Appendix C6-B and have been extracted from the
           City of Pickering report “Seaton Sustainable Place-Making Guidelines, July 2011 (draft)”.

           6.4.2 NHS CROSSING DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

           The NHS will be crossed by several roadways as established by the CPDP and as
           shown on Figures C6.1 and C6.2. The selection of these crossing areas, based on the
           CPDP planned locations for the roads and by additional evaluation in this MESPA, has
           taken into account the characteristics of the NHS including terrestrial features, aquatic
           features, or both. To meet the goal of minimizing potential for environmental impacts of
           the proposed road crossings, the MESP Study Team recommends road alignments that
           avoid wetlands and woodlands. Where the crossing is a necessity, then crossing widths
           have been minimized.

           For all City roads, road design will be outlined in the Neighbourhood Plan and
           Neighbourhood Functional Servicing and Stormwater Reports (NFSSRs). Prior to the
           construction of any roads or buildings, detailed design subject to review and approvals
           by the City of Pickering, TRCA, MNR and other relevant agencies must be approved.

           For the three City roads subject to Schedule ‘C’ of the MEA Class EA process, the
           design requirements for each watercourse or terrestrial natural heritage feature crossing
           will be considered further on a site specific basis during the future Environmental Study
           Reports to satisfy Phases 3 and 4 of the MEA Class EA. The design and opening size
           for all NHS crossings, where applicable, must address a number of basic parameters,
           including fluvial geomorphology, hydraulics, and wildlife passage requirements.

           For each segment of a City road which is proposed to cross through or intrude into the
           NHS, a Roads Checklist Form was prepared (see Appendix C6-C). The Form indicates
           which criteria or mitigation measure should be followed and when (i.e. large mammal
           crossing design at the NFSSR stage). It also provides direction to site specific
           assessments outlining any special conditions or design considerations for that NHS road
           segment. This Roads Checklist Form is to be annotated with the assessment results by
           the NFSSRs, providing a summary of the design parameters for each road segment
           through the NHS.

           As shown below, and on the Roads Checklist Forms, there are numerous criteria that
           must be considered, but not all criteria would be applicable for all road segments. In
           terrestrial locations, the use of NHS crossings by wildlife will affect the design. In
           channel crossing locations, the overriding criterion dictating the size of the opening will
           be the one that results in the largest opening size.

           Twenty-seven (27) Roads Checklist Forms have been prepared, applicable to crossings
           1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15a, 15b, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29,
           30, 31 and 32 (Appendix C6-C). The location and extent of each crossing is shown on
           Figure C6.2. There are no Roads Checklist Forms for crossings 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 as these
           are existing roads (Whitevale Road and North Road) that are not being modified at this
           time, and are not subject to assessment at the NFSSR stage. However, these crossings

           continue to be shown on Figure C6.1 and in Table 1 of Appendix C6-A as
           modifications to these roads may occur in the future, and existing conditions information
           has been acquired through this MESP process. Further, there is no crossing #24, and
           thus no checklist for this crossing. All other crossings through the NHS (i.e. the ‘lettered’
           crossings, A, B, C... etc.), are Regional Roads, the design of which is being undertaken
           through the CPDP Regional Services Class EA Study.

           The NFSSRs will provide a preliminary plan and profile for each of the above noted
           roads segments through the NHS.

           The design criteria to be applied to City roads through the NHS are detailed in Table
           C6.13, below.

         TABLE C6.13: DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR CITY ROADS THROUGH SEATON NHS

         Criterion                                            Assessment Requirements
1. Hydraulics                      •     Crossings are to be sized to convey the applicable storm as per Pickering
                                         Stormwater Management Guidelines, which is the greater of the 50 year
                                         flood flow, or the flood flow specified by Ontario Ministry of Transportation
                                         Design Flood Criteria Directive B-100.
                                   •     Crossings are to be sized in accordance with TRCA floodplain management
                                         criteria for water crossings.
                                   •     The crossings are to be sized, based on the flow regimes predicted for the
                                         post-development conditions, paying special attention to intermittent
                                         channels/swales that may exhibit more persistent flow conditions post-
                                         development.
                                   •     The proposed crossings should be assessed to ensure MNR requirements
                                         for safe egress are achieved (i.e. ensure road profiles are such that if a
                                         structure is overtopped during a Regional Storm event, then the depth of
                                         flooding will not impede emergency vehicles).
2. Fluvial                         •     The following criteria are recommended for crossing placement and design.
   Geomorphology                         The crossing location should:
                                           o be stable, relatively straight reach of channel, where possible;
                                           o within an envelope outside the potential future migration of upstream
                                                meanders (a 100-year planning horizon);
                                           o cross the stream perpendicular to the channel, whenever possible.
                                   •     The crossing opening should address potential channel migration, with the
                                         aim to minimizing or avoiding the requirements for armouring or impacting
                                         channel migration or adjustment (100-year planning horizon), considering
                                         post-development conditions, especially for intermittent channels/swales
                                         where the flow regime may change under post-development conditions.
                                         The minimum structural requirement from a geomorphic perspective is to
                                         ensure that abutments on any watercourse crossing are located outside the
                                         100 year erosion limit. Crossings will avoid, to the best extent possible,
                                         watercourses that have fine sediment banks and are vegetation controlled.
                                         Where it is not possible to avoid fine sediment banks and vegetation
                                         control, formalizing the channel with appropriate bed and/or bank
                                         treatments may be required to avoid splaying/braiding under low flow
                                         conditions.
                                   •     The crossing opening should not:
                                         o impact channel velocity for frequent storm events;
                                         o Impact the local existing meander pattern; and

                                   •     Other hazards that should be addressed include:
                                         o bedload conveyance through the crossing;
                                         o potential change in channel alignment and bank erosion in adjoining
                                              reaches; and
                                         o ice jams and woody debris, where applicable.
3. Stormwater                      •     Quality, erosion and quantity controls must be provided for road drainage,
   Management                            through the implementation of best management practices and low impact
   Requirements                          development measures.
                                   •     Storm drainage from urban cross-section roads should be directed to
                                         stormwater management facilities unless grades are prohibitive. Where
                                         this is the case, alternative BMP/LIDs will be considered to address water
                                         management requirements.
4. Fisheries                       •     The general intent is to leave existing bed of channels untouched, thus
                                         minimizing the extent of a HADD.
                                   •     Open bottom structures are required for all channel crossings.
                                   •     Where a structure is required to direct accumulated flow from a non-
                                         channelized area (i.e. no channel present), the structure should be
                                         designed to accommodate the function of the replicated flow.
                                   •     If a HADD is identified, review the Overall Fisheries Compensation Plan,
                                         and identify the Opportunities for Compensation indicated in the Plan.
                                         Provide direction re: implementation.
5. Geotechnical and                •     The soil conditions and slope stability (where applicable) at a proposed
   Hydrogeology                          crossing must be assessed to identify construction constraints.
                                   •     The local groundwater conditions should be identified (i.e. depth to water
                                         table, potential for groundwater/surface water interaction (discharge), and
                                         need for construction dewatering) at the crossing location to maintain or
                                         enhance existing discharge function.
                                   •     Where dewatering will be necessary, the pumping requirements and
                                         potential impacts should be identified and the appropriate monitoring and
                                         mitigation plans should be prepared.
6. Wildlife Passage                •     Wildlife passage needs to be addressed for every location where a road
                                         segment will cross through the NHS. The characteristics of the NHS in
                                         each location will dictate the requirements related to wildlife passage. The
                                         characteristics may vary from: a narrow watercourse crossing, with adjacent
                                         narrow bands of currently agriculture; a watercourse crossing with a well-
                                         defined, diversely vegetated valley, with or without adjacent terrestrial NHS
                                         that may or may not currently be well vegetated; and, areas where no
                                         watercourse is present and the vegetation may vary from current agriculture
                                         to structurally diverse natural communities.
                                   •     For a successful crossing, the design must consider: the existing and future
                                         habitat conditions; the wildlife functional groups in the vicinity and wildlife
                                         accessibility; and, human activity that will occur in the future (in addition to
                                         the road, i.e. trails, sidewalks). Design components must include:
                                         appropriate structure design (shape, size, light, moisture); appropriate road
                                         design elements (curbs, barriers, ditches); and, traffic control measures
                                         (signage, speed limit).
                                   •     Wildlife functional groups comprise: large mammals (e.g. deer); medium
                                         mammals (e.g. raccoon); small mammals; amphibians and riparian reptiles;
                                         and, upland reptiles (some snakes). Additionally, there are fish; these are
                                         addressed under #4, above. Many crossings will function for a number of
                                         wildlife groups and the points, below, reflect this.

                                   •     Some researchers and Agencies recommend the use of the ‘Openness
                                         Index’ (width of opening x height of opening [clearance])/length of opening)
                                         for openings (culverts, bridges, underpasses) planned for wildlife use. This
                                         tool can be used to determine if the opening is generally suitable for the
                                         proposed wildlife groups:
                                         o For large mammals - have an openness index of at least 0.75 but
                                              preferably 0.9;
                                         o For medium mammals – have an openness index of at least 0.4;
                                         o For small mammals, amphibians and riparian reptiles, the literature
                                              suggests quite a large range but indicate that smaller openness indices
                                              are more appealing to these groups, as long as a dry shoulder is
                                              maintained. It is suggested that the openness index could range from a
                                              low of 0.08 to 0.4;
                                         o For upland reptiles, the literature indicates that the use of the Openness
                                              Index is not useful.
                                         o The appropriateness of the openness index should be considered in the
                                              context of the site specific conditions in any given location and the
                                              species anticipated to inhabit the NHS in that location, at the NFSSR or
                                              detailed design phases, as applicable.

                                    Channel Crossing Requirements:
                                    • Where aquatic habitat exists, the crossing structures should be open
                                       bottom and accommodate the existing substrate.
                                    • Where large top-of-bank to top-of-bank structures will be required to span
                                       a deep valley, it may provide suitable height and width for all wildlife
                                       groups.
                                    • The requirements for target (i.e. those in the area that will utilize the
                                       crossing) wildlife groups are outlined below.
                                       o Large sized and medium sized mammals require an open field of view
                                          (i.e. can see to the other side of the opening), and preferably structures
                                          that are taller in height, shorter in length, with larger cross-sectional
                                          areas and openness indices. Smaller sized mammals will use these
                                          openings as well.
                                       o Larger sized mammals require openings with a minimum of 3m height.
                                       o Medium sized mammals require openings with 1-1.2m height.
                                       o Small sized mammals, amphibians, and riparian reptiles require
                                          openings with 0.3-0.5m height.
                                       o All non-aquatic wildlife groups require a continuous terrestrial bench
                                          beside the flow channel. Although some small mammals and herptiles
                                          have been known to utilize benches of as small as 0.4m, in most
                                          situations a minimum width of ~3-4m, would be required on both sides
                                          of channel bank where the connectivity is required to accommodate
                                          medium and large sized mammals. The target species and the specific
                                          bench size will be determined at the NFSSR or detailed design phases,
                                          as applicable.
                                   •   To further enhance the potential for wildlife use of the crossing structures,
                                       any valley design and naturalization plans should meet the following
                                       requirements:
                                       o The road embankments (from both sides of the road to the valley
                                           system) should not have overly steep grades. Slope conditions should
                                           encourage funnelling of wildlife but should not be so steep that wildlife
                                           could not readily leave adjacent level areas to access the opening.
                                       o The embankments on both sides of the road should be planted with

                                               structurally diverse native indigenous species that would provide cover
                                               in the vicinity of the road but that would not impede sight of the
                                               opening.
                                   •     To enhance the visibility of the opening for wildlife, to encourage funnelling
                                         of wildlife to the opening, and to discourage them from exiting the opening
                                         to the road surface, a hard surface apron around the entrance, and a lip
                                         around the top of the opening are recommended.
                                   •     The route to the opening (on both sides of the road) should be planted with
                                         indigenous species that provide cover to the fauna.

                                   Terrestrial Crossing Requirements:
                                   • Adjacent to channel crossings and in locations where no channel is present
                                       where a road segment crosses through the NHS, wildlife connectivity also
                                       should be addressed.
                                   • For Amphibians/Reptiles:
                                       o Where a channel crossing is not required but where amphibian/riparian
                                           reptile habitat exists in close proximity to both sides of a road (±∼100m)
                                           or there is evidence that amphibians are broadcasting across the
                                           terrain, an underpass may be required.
                                       o Where broadcast movement is to be supported, the crossings should
                                           be placed at a high frequency (e.g. ~50m).
                                       o Crossing structures for this wildlife group can have small openings
                                           although it is difficult to ensure that the microclimate in the structure is
                                           not significantly different from their surroundings, which is easier to
                                           accomplish with larger openings. The crossing structure should have a
                                           minimum diameter of ~0.3-0.5m, but this will depend on the road width
                                           and should result in the appropriate openness index. Concrete or PVC
                                           materials are preferred to help maintain ambient temperatures. The
                                           base material for the crossings should be natural materials, preferably
                                           soil and stone from the surrounding area.
                                       o Crossing structures for amphibians should have grated openings (to
                                           barrier predatory small mammals from entering), flush with the road to
                                           allow for greater air and moisture flow and improved ambient light, thus
                                           enhancing the potential to maintain suitable microclimatic conditions.
                                           The crossing structure must provide non-flooded but moist passage.
                                       o There has been good success where the barrier/guiding feature to the
                                           crossing structure entrance includes a +15 cm horizontal lip along its
                                           top (herptiles and small mammals are not able to clamber over this
                                           barrier (‘gravity takes over’) to access the road). The guiding feature
                                           may be concrete slab or block that faces (covers) the verge, forming an
                                           apron around the entrance to the underpass – this would be topped
                                           with the lip or rim. This design is preferred, as it does not create a
                                           barrier for fauna crossing at grade, and the regular maintenance
                                           requirements would be less than for a drift fence.
                                       o The vegetation cover at the crossing structure entrance should be low
                                           stature (forbs, graminoids), to prevent the wildlife climbing up the
                                           vegetation. Low stature vegetation (forbs, graminoids, small shrubs)
                                           cover in the vicinity and other naturally occurring habitat, such as tree
                                           stumps, hollow logs, or rocks, is beneficial to provide cover from
                                           predators and encourage passage through a structure.
                                   • For Mammals:

                                         o   In some locations where road designs and grades can accommodate it,
                                             underpass crossings for medium mammals could be considered.
                                             These mammals (e.g. raccoon, skunk, fox, etc.) are not frequent users
                                             of underpasses in urban settings (typically they broadcast their
                                             movements through the community), and therefore should only be
                                             considered for locations where there is a reasonable road segment
                                             length through the NHS. If an underpass is proposed, its design should
                                             address the openness index, opening height and line of sight, as
                                             discussed above, under ‘Channel Crossings’.
                                         o Where an underpass is not proposed, the road should be kept to as
                                             close to at-grade with the surrounding lands (i.e. there should not be
                                             any steep grades immediately beside the road rights-of-way).
                                         o On both sides of the roads, vegetation that provides cover should be
                                             established, while maintaining a clear line-of-sight for drivers, along the
                                             shoulders of the road (i.e. there should be a strip of low stature
                                             vegetation or shoulder beside the travel surface).
                                         o Appropriate signage should be placed on the road (warnings related to
                                             wildlife crossing, speed limit reduction, no passing).
                                         o No physical barrier to at-grade crossings should be established (e.g. no
                                             continuous fencing that extends to the ground surface). Guard rails/
                                             guide rails/posts have not been found to create a barrier to movement.
                                         o Reflectors/reflecting material on guard rails/guide rails/posts/road
                                             edges, etc. may enhance the ability of the wildlife to pick up on the
                                             vehicles. This is more beneficial than increased street lighting, which
                                             may deter some animals from using the crossing location.
                                   •     Alternative road design standards may minimize implications to wildlife
                                         movement. The travelled surface of the road should be kept to the
                                         minimum permitted and the road segments should be relatively straight.
                                         Rural road cross-sections may be suitable in locations where steep grade
                                         changes do not exist across the road, where roadside swales can be
                                         accommodated without creating substantial swaths within the NHS; and,
                                         where length allows. The locations for light poles should be considered,
                                         based on the wildlife expected to utilize the crossing.
7. Vegetation                      •     Edge management will be required where existing edges have to be
   Management                            removed and where the interior of a woodland is exposed. Cut woody
                                         material could be left in situ to provide habitat and cover, unless diseased.
                                         Alternatively, cut material could be chipped and used on site as ground
                                         mulch. In general, other than where concerns of public safety exist, snags
                                         and deadfalls should be left in place. There should not be any significant
                                         landscaping or manicuring of areas that are to be left to function naturally.
                                   •     Restoration measures should be implemented wherever and whenever
                                         communities are disturbed/removed to accommodate road construction.
                                         The restored vegetation community should reflect the cover that was
                                         present (e.g. wetland or upland). Exceptions exist where (1) the cover is
                                         agriculture in which case full restoration should occur; and (2) herbaceous
                                         cover is appropriate to establish clear lines-of-sight for wildlife-vehicle
                                         safety.
                                   •     Where the location of the road has been altered from that shown in the
                                         CPDP and impacts to the NHS are greater (i.e. road moved from across
                                         agricultural cover to across a natural community) or where additional road
                                         crossings of the NHS are proposed, compensation is required for any

                                         ensure that there is a net gain to natural cover within the NHS. The
                                         compensation should occur within the areas of the NHS that currently
                                         support agricultural uses, and endeavour to replace the lost natural heritage
                                         features (e.g. wetland with wetland, woodland with woodland).
                                         In locations where a road may traverse the surface catchment of a natural
                                         heritage feature, especially wetlands, road design must ensure
                                         maintenance of drainage to the feature per a water balance calculation.
8. Species at Risk                 •     Regarding Butternut trees, confirm that no Butternut trees are present on or
                                         in vicinity of alignment.
                                   •     If present, undertake a Butternut Health Assessment after which, and
                                         depending upon the health and number of specimens present, either:
                                         o Modify alignment, or
                                         o Apply for permit for removal, following the requirements of Section 5 of
                                              Ontario Regulation 242/08 for Butternut (under the Endangered
                                              Species Act [ESA]; as to be revised in 2011).
                                   •     Regarding Redside Dace, confirm category of any channels in
                                         subcatchment (i.e. occupied, recovery or indirect) and meet requirements of
                                         Overall Benefit Plan for Redside Dace (described in Chapter E of this
                                         MESPA).
                                   •     Other ESA species (as of April 2011) have been addressed in the MESPA,
                                         Chapter E, and therefore do not need to be addressed in the NFSSRs.
                                   •     In the future (i.e. beyond the summer of 2011), as development plans are
                                         implemented, the ESA should be revisited to determine whether additional
                                         species present in the plan area have been added to the ‘endangered’ or
                                         ‘threatened’ category, and would need to be addressed.
9. Road Design                     •     Design standards for NHS crossings should be coordinated with the City
                                         and the Region for consistent application.
                                   •     Each NHS crossing should be assessed to determine whether a rural
                                         cross-section is feasible or whether the road should continue as an urban
                                         (or semi-urban with rolled curb and roadside ditches) cross-section through
                                         the NHS. This should be based on such factors as: length, grade, design
                                         speed, and abutting land cover.
                                   •     Where NHS crossing has suitable characteristics for the road to
                                         accommodate the transition from urban to rural cross-section, the following
                                         shall be considered:
                                         o Transition curb treatment (start and end of the urban section)
                                         o Accommodate roadway drainage
                                         o Provide for the continuation of sidewalk and/or integrate with trail
                                         o Provide for the continuation of bike lane
                                         o Provide for the continuation of street lighting although the type of
                                              lighting should be sensitive to the NHS (i.e. full cut off)
                                         o Provide appropriate signage for transition into and out NHS
                                         o Provide for guiderail, if necessary
                                         o Provide safety features for all modes such as vehicles, pedestrian,
                                              cyclists, etc.
                                         o Provide access to utilities
10. Natural Heritage               •     Review plan for Natural Heritage System Trails and Trails/bike routes to
    System Trails                        determine whether there is a trail section proposed along or across (i.e. an
                                         intersection) the road and ensure that road design will accommodate trail
                                         requirements (e.g. underpass design; intersection design; contiguous trail
                                         section).

7.0        SEATON TRANSIT NETWORK

7.1        DURHAM TRANSIT (POTENTIAL ROUTES/COVERAGE)
           For bus routings in Seaton, a number of alternative routing plans were developed and
           assessed in order to ensure that the requirement for 400m walking distance for transit
           access is achieved. This requirement has made it necessary for the addition of two new
           collector roads to the CPDP to provide adequate coverage (400m walking distance). As
           a consequence, emergency access has been improved. The Plan defines major transit
           corridors as “corridors that have the potential to develop into higher order service in
           exclusive rights-of-way, and facilitate inter-regional and local travel”. Accordingly, the
           following corridors are identified as Major transit corridors:

           •     Highway 407 Transitway;
           •     Brock Road,
           •     Taunton Road;
           •     Whites Road/Sideline Road 26 and
           •     Highway 7.

           According to the CPDP, these corridors will:

           •     Provide a direct connection to York and Peel Regions along Highway 407, as well as
                 to major employment and institutional uses near the highway;
           •     Provide a direct connection to the Pickering GO Rail Station on the Lakeshore East
                 GO Rail line along Brock Road, as well as the Highway 2 transit corridor and the
                 future Seaton GO Station;
           •     Connect to all major attractors and generators of traffic in the City of Pickering along
                 Brock Road and Whites Road;
           •     Connect easterly into Durham Region for major educational and institutional centres
                 along Highway 407, Highway 7, Taunton Road, and existing Rossland Road; and,
           •     Connect to a proposed Pickering Airport to the north of the Development Planning
                 Area.

           Minor transit corridors, on the other hand, will provide local service within the Seaton
           area. Minor transit corridors identified in the CPDP (Schedule 4) include Rossland
           Road/Sideline Road 22 and other collector and arterial roads as identified in Figure
           C7.1.

           7.1.1 ROUTE PLANNING

           Details of potential routing plans for each development phase are contained in the
           Seaton SSIS Update (May 2013) and are provided in Appendix C2. These plans were
           developed so that the majority of the development areas are within a 5-minute walk (or

           out in the CPDP.

7.2        SEATON GO STATION
           The CPDP (Figure C1.1) proposed a new GO Transit rail station near Taunton Road
           west of Brock Road along the CPR Belleville Subdivision. A number of constraints and
           operational issues have been identified with providing a GO service to Seaton on the
           CPR Belleville Subdivision. Until GO Transit completes further study into this matter, it
           is prudent to protect for a station location on the CPR Belleville Subdivision and three
           sites were evaluated in this MESPA.

           Two potential GO Transit rail station sites along the CPR (that are not within the NHS)
           were identified on the west side of Brock Road and a third possible station site was
           identified east of Brock Road. The three sites that were evaluated are shown in Figure
           C7.2 and are identified as the West, Central and East Sites. The constraints of the CPR
           Belleville line and these sites have been discussed with GO Transit staff. The GO rail
           tracks will be located to the south of the existing CPR tracks. The evaluation of each of
           the sites is described in Table C7.1.

           Based on the evaluation above, this assessment concluded that the East Site is the
           preferred location for a proposed Seaton GO station and should be “protected” for that
           use. It complies with the CPDP Policy 1b (page 55) “Upon identifying the station
           location(s), re-examine the abutting land-uses to ensure an appropriate mix and intensity
           of land-uses is permitted.”

7.3        REGIONAL TRANSIT SERVICE
           This section discusses other transit improvements that could contribute to reducing car
           use by residents and workers within the Seaton Community as well as southwest
           Pickering. This discussion is not limited to what is already planned, but includes a
           discussion of other potential improvements that could offer additional trip choice benefits
           to north Pickering (and locations further afield).

           7.3.1 WHITES ROAD GO STATION

           The analysis of the transit service within Seaton and the linkages to the existing urban
           areas in Pickering has determined that Whites Road and Brock Road should each
           provide higher order transit service. This conclusion is consistent with the report on the
           Region of Durham’s Long Term Transit Strategy, March 2010.

           The Brock Road transit service is included in “The Big Move” as Project #39, although
           there is no reference in that report to higher order transit on Whites Road. Consideration
           could be given to locating a second GO station where the future Seaton GO Rail service
           crosses Whites Road, which could serve Seaton as well as the existing developed areas
           of southwest Pickering although it is outside the CPDP boundary. It is also significant
           that Whites Road intersects the future 407 BRT and the northerly extension, as
           proposed by the GTAA, would connect to the main passenger terminal building of the
           future proposed Pickering Airport.

           A further benefit from a Whites Road GO Station is that parking can be provided on the
           Hydro right-of-way and reduce the need for parking at the Brock/Taunton location
           thereby increasing the development potential as required in the CPDP.

           7.3.2 METROLINX

           The proposal to provide GO Rail service to Seaton is included in the Metrolinx report
           “The Big Move”, identified as Project 14 in Schedule 1: 15-Year Plan for the Regional
           Rapid Transit and Highway Network. Preliminary discussions with GO Transit and CPR
           identified a number of concerns, which will need to be addressed including:

           •     Rail connections to Union Station (which currently are not available),
           •     Station capacity at Union Station is not confirmed,
           •     Resolution of rail conflicts with CPR operations at Agincourt Yard,
           •     Establishing a station at Summerhill (as an alternate to Union Station),
           •     Operating a GO Rail on the CP Belleville Subdivision, and
           •     Additional structures crossing over the Rouge Valley.

           The resolution of these issues may delay the introduction of rail transit and consequently
           the transit analysis in this report has focused on bus transit including connections to the
           existing Highway 407 GO BRT, which over time will be upgraded to a separate
           Transitway, as well as the existing GO Lakeshore Rail Line and GO bus service on
           Highway 401 with a focus on connections to Scarborough in general and TTC routes in
           particular.

           ”The Big Move” Schedule 1 conceptually shows the intersection of three proposed transit
           lines (Havelock [GO] regional rail, Highway 407 BTR, and York Region’s VIVA bus
           service), at Highway 407 and Locust Hill, approximately 5 km west of Whites Road.

8.0        ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION
           The active transportation system includes the trail system developed in “Seaton Natural
           Heritage System Management Plan and Master Trails Plan”, (NHS/Trails Plan) October
           2008 including on-road 1.5m bike lanes along the Collector roads, 3m asphalt paths
           within the right-of-way of the Type C Arterial roads, as well as a network of 3m paths
           through the NHS linking the Community Facilities and neighbourhoods. Figure C8.1
           illustrates the Active Transportation Network as developed in “NHS/Trails Plan.” The
           trail locations shown on Figure C8.1 have been modified from that shown in the
           “NHS/Trails Plan”, and reflect the Neighbourhood Plans prepared by the City of
           Pickering and also that shown in OPA 22. As these relocated trails did not receive the
           same level of site specific investigations regarding natural heritage and natural hazards
           (including topography), as occurred as part of the preparation of the Master Trail Plan,
           further appropriate field investigations are required. Prior to the construction of the trails
           systems within the NHS, an appropriate EA for the trails will be prepared, by the public
           authority that has determined that it will construct the trails. The Developer Land
           Owners of Seaton will be responsible only for construction of the Trailheads, which will
           not require an EA.

           The CPDP mandated consideration of active transportation choices including the Seaton
           trail system, on-road bicycle lanes, paths within road rights-of-way and paths within the
           NHS linking neighbourhoods as developed in the NHS/Trails Plan. The active
           transportation system was designed to provide connections and linkages among the
           Seaton Community neighbourhoods to reduce reliance on automobiles and thereby

           reduce environmental impacts. The trail plan identifies locations for trail system through
           NHS to minimize potential random use.

           For the active transportation choices, Seaton roads will be designed with dedicated on-
           road bicycle lanes or multi-use trails in the right-of-way to service residents of the
           development areas. In order to implement these choices, it is recommended that each
           plan of subdivision review the NHS/Trails Plan and particularly the bike routes to
           determine whether there is a trail section proposed along or across the road to ensure
           that road design will accommodate trail requirements (e.g. underpass design;
           intersection design; continuous trail section).

9.0        ALTERNATE INITIATIVES
           Travel Demand Management (TDM) is the term used to describe initiatives, policies and
           recommendations to reduce the public’s dependence on the car and use alternate
           modes of transportation (transit, carpooling, walking, cycling, active transportation) which
           will contribute to the reduction of overall congestion and parking requirements. TDM
           measures can include but are not limited to the following:

           •     Reliable transit,
           •     Live – work communities,
           •     Employer initiatives through flexible working hours, compressed work weeks, and
                 telecommuting,
           •     Employer incentives to encourage users of other modes of transportation,
           •     Bicycle storage facilities,
           •     Shower facilities for cyclists and active commuters (run, walk),
           •     Encourage higher auto occupancy with carpool networks, such as Smart Commute’s
                 Carpool Zone and providing priority or convenient parking locations,
           •     Encourage auto-share, such as Zipcar / AutoShare,
           •     Minimize available parking to promote other transportation modes and to maximize
                 shared-use parking, and
           •     Increase awareness of alternative transportation modes through education and
                 advertising.

           From the list above, one can see that TDM measures can be physical elements as well
           as non-physical, such as operational programs and behavioural characteristics.

           Potentially, residents of the development do not need to own a vehicle for transportation
           – they can take transit to work, shop, or leisure – recreation activities. The residents can
           ride-share with friends and co-workers (carpools) or belong to an auto-share club. The
           City may consider implementing policies or zoning by-laws to ensure reserved areas for
           bicycle storage is provided in multi-residential and public buildings.

           The Seaton plan includes bike lanes, bike paths and trails in the NHS which provide
           alternatives (walking, running, cycling) to using a vehicle to get to places within the
           community. In summary, the possibilities exist in Seaton to measurably reduce auto-
           dependency and auto-driver trips over similar new communities since all or a
           combination of these TDM practices is planned to be implemented.

10.0 CONFORMITY WITH MEA CLASS EA PROCESS
           As detailed in Chapter A, Sections 1.0 and 9.0, the MESP Terms of Reference require
           that this MESPA meets the requirements of the MEA Class EA process, specifically the
           first two phases with regard to confirming the road and transit network requirements as
           set out in the CPDP. A requirement of the MEA Class EA process is to establish the
           capital costs of the works in order to establish which schedule applies. If the capital
           costs of the works were estimated to exceed $2.7 million in 2009 (the year that the initial
           cost estimates were made for the purpose of selecting a Class EA Schedule, in
           accordance with MEA Class EA requirements) then the project is identified as Schedule
           ‘C’ and will require Phases 3 and 4 of the MEA Class EA process. Please note that the
           Municipal Engineers Association (MEA) updates its road project cost limits yearly (see
           www.municipalclassea.ca) with instructions that "the Cost Limit threshold in place at the
           time a project is initiated shall be the cost threshold used to determine the applicable
           Schedule and process to be followed throughout until the completion of the Class EA
           process".

           In accordance with the definitions of costs in the MEA Class EA the capital costs of the
           Type C Arterial and Collector roads, including oversizing costs, were estimated and are
           presented here in Table C10.1.

           From Table C10.1 the following road projects have been identified as being subject to
           Schedule ‘C’ of the MEA Class EA:

           •     Road I - North-South Type C Arterial (Sideline 24) ($6.77 million)
           •     Road IV - East-West Special Type C Arterial ($5.77 million)
           •     Road VI - East-West Employment Collector ($4.5 million)

           As a result of discussions with MTO, the Seaton Landowners Group has confirmed that
           extensions to Sideline 26/Whites Road and Sideline 22/Rossland Road will not be
           permitted to have intersections between Highway 7 and the westbound ramp termini of
           Highway 407 ETR. Consequently, a continuous east-west collector road in these
           locations is not feasible. The road network to serve the Prestige Employment uses in
           this area will be in the form of local roads with connections to Highway 7. The
           alignments for these roads will be determined by the lot configurations of the
           employment uses, phasing of employment uses and the intersection spacing
           requirements for Highway 7. As a result, these roads, previously identified as collector
           roads, will no longer be subject to the Municipal Class EA (i.e. they will be Schedule A)
           and their locations will be determined via the Planning Act approvals process for the
           employment lands.

           Table C10.2 presents the next steps to be undertaken for the three City roads identified
           as Schedule ‘C’ projects.

11.0 SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDED SEATON TRANSPORTATION
     NETWORK
           The recommended Seaton road network has been designed to accommodate alternative
           Durham Region Transit routes. The proposed transportation network including both
           roads and transit is shown on Figure C11.1. Table C11.1 summarizes:

                a)     A description of each of the recommended arterial and collector road alignments
                       and their designations;
                b)     the required mitigation measures for crossings of the NHS. For a complete list of
                       environmental design considerations, see Table C6.13;
                c)     an indication as to whether the road is subject to Phases 3 and 4 of the MEA
                       Class EA; and

12.0 RECOMMENDATIONS
           The recommendations of this MESPA with regards to transportation are as follows:

           City of Pickering

           •     City road alignment modifications are recommended as presented in Chapter C,
                 Section 11.0.
           •     Work with GO Transit to protect the East Site (as described in Chapter C, Section
                 7.2 Seaton Go Station) as the preferred location for a proposed Seaton GO station.
           •     City transfer to the Region the jurisdiction of Whitevale Road between Brock Road
                 and the Realigned Whitevale Road.
           •     Ensure the construction of the City roads according to the phasing contained in the
                 revised Seaton SSIS, May 2013.

           Region of Durham

           •     Ensure the construction of the Regional roads according to the phasing contained in
                 the revised Seaton SSIS, May 2013.
           •     Coordinate Whites Road construction with 407ETR at the interchange.
           •     Download to the City the existing Brock Road between the north and south limits of
                 the realigned Brock Road.

           MTO

           •     Consider transfer of Highway 7 to the Regions of Durham and York, so that the MEA
                 Class EA study can begin for the widening of Highway 7 within each Region’s
                 jurisdiction.

           407ETR

           •     Implement the recommendations with regard to the proposed Whites Road and
                 Rossland Road interchanges with 407ETR as set out in this study and the revised
                 Seaton SSIS, May 2013: that the Whites Road interchange be constructed first and
                 be operational by no later than 2018 and that the Rossland Road interchange
                 construction be constructed (when justified by traffic demand) however no later than
                 2028.
           •     Obtain MOE approval for an Environmental Assessment Addendum to 407 East EA
                 to update Whites Road and Rossland Road interchange locations.

           Metrolinx / GO Transit

           •     GO Transit to provide rail service along the Belleville Subdivision and protect for a
                 station (preferably not a terminus) in the southeast quadrant of Brock Road and
                 Taunton Road and potentially a second station located at Whites Road.
           •     Metrolinx to pursue approvals for transit locations along 407ETR at Whites Road,
                 Rossland Road Extension and York Durham Line. (As noted in Chapter C, Section
                 3.3.1, due to environmental and cultural constraints in the vicinity of the proposed
                 transit station at Brock Road, Whites Road and also Rossland Road Extension

                 locations, it may be necessary to advance construction of a transit station at York
                 Durham Line.
           •     A transit station at Whites Road will require EA Act approval.

           General

           •     All parties to examine the ongoing results of the SSIS and MESPA recommended
                 monitoring. Determine if changes are necessary resulting from the implementation
                 of various projects or phasing. At each Phase, the monitoring results will be
                 considered and may be incorporated into the design of each City road alignment.

           Seaton Landowners Group

           •     Conduct Environmental Study Reports for the following City road projects in
                 accordance with Phases 3 and 4 of the MEA Class EA planning process:
                 o Road I – North-south Type C Arterial (Sideline Road 24),
                 o Road IV – East-West Special Type C Arterial (North), and
                 o Road VI – Employment Collector.
           •     Design NHS crossings in accordance with site specific mitigation measures, as
                 addressed in Chapter C, Section 6.4.2 and Chapter C, Section 11.0. For all NHS
                 crossings the ‘Design Considerations For City Roads Through Seaton NHS’ as set
                 out in Table C6.13 must be addressed.
           •     Adopt the recommendations with regard to Endangered Species presented in
                 Chapter C, Section 6.2.
           •     Monitor any additional species at risk identified by MNR in the vicinity of City roads
                 and ensure that a MNR permit or an update to the Overall Benefit Plan or Mitigation
                 Plan where appropriate (see Chapter E) be addressed in accordance with the
                 Endangered Species Act.
           •     Obtain, where required, appropriate permits from the TRCA prior to construction of
                 City roads.
           •     Proceed in accordance with the framework for fisheries compensation as provided in
                 Chapter F for all stream crossings, where there is potential for harmful alteration,
                 disruption or destruction or disturbance (HADD) at stream crossings, under the
                 Federal Fisheries Act. Note that these provisions may be in addition to any
                 requirements associated with the Redside Dace Overall Benefit Plan or Mitigation
                 Plan where applicable.

inability to provide new roadway links through the Rouge Park as a result of current Provincial Policy (“no
new roads in the Rouge Park”). This policy generates challenges to the development of future transit
corridors linking Durham, York and Toronto. As noted earlier, the Study Area also lacks any significant transit
service. Attempts to provide transit service to the CPDP area must be undertaken in conjunction with arterial
roadway improvements in the area to permit a “transit first” plan with any chance of success.

To address the other transportation problems within the Study Area and the future travel demands of
residents and employees in the Central Pickering Area, a number of structural and non-structural
improvements are required. The infrastructure, service, and planning considerations identified in this report
should be reviewed as a package of system improvements. In this regard, there are several initiatives, both
structural and non-structural, which are considered early priorities or “quick starts” in order to facilitate growth
and provide opportunities for greater mode choice and reduced reliance on the automobile.

Transportation strategies identified in the early phases of implementation should promote a “transit first”
approach to transit service for the Central Pickering area. Key initiatives such as the provision of transit
services on Taunton Road/Steeles Avenue, 407 and Highway 7 should be coordinated with the respective
road network improvements to enable early implementation of a “transit first” approach. Without many of
these infrastructure improvements the ability to make early and meaningful transit service available in the
Study Area is severely hindered. Without these improvements it must be expected that current modal
patterns (low transit use) will prevail and ultimately become entrenched in the urban fabric of the future
community resulting in the need for further roadway infrastructure improvements and less emphasis on
transit service.

It is worth noting that the structural and non-structural improvements identified in this report can not alone
guarantee a “transit first” plan for the CPDP area – there is a need for a transformational philosophical
approach by the approving authorities in the planning and implementation of the community. Approving the
most appropriate land use, densities and development staging, including the early development of
employment lands, will be critical to support the transportation initiatives recommended herein. Approving
“business as usual” low density residential development will not result in a transit supportive plan even when
combined with the transportation initiatives described in this report.

The transit improvements recommended in support of the CPDP plan are summarized in Table A and shown
in Exhibit 1 below.

       purposes only to provide an indication of the level of initial capital and ongoing operational costs associated
       with transit services within the CPDP.

       Capital costs for the conventional services described above could be in the order of $97 -$105 Million (2008
       dollars). These costs do not include property costs but include the following:

               •   Conventional transit vehicles;
               •   Community buses;
               •   Specialized vehicles;
               •   Communications and other ITS equipment;
               •   Transit maintenance and garage facilities;
               •   Bus stops and stations;
               •   Bus Shelters;
               •   Transit stations and park’n’ride facilities along 407 East (Sidelines 22 and 26 and Brock Road)

       Net operating costs for the conventional services described above could be in the order of $12-$15 Million
       per annum (2008 dollars).

       These costs do not include capital or operating cost estimates associated with the following.
          • Infrastructure and services to be provided and operated by GO Transit;
          • Any services that may be provided by York Region or TTC directly to the CPDP area.

       The roadway improvements recommended in support of the CPDP plan are summarized in Table B and
       shown in Exhibit 2 below.

        Figure C, Development Phasing Plan, identifies the limits of the Phase 1 Living Area
        which will contain up to 9,800 SDEs and the Phase 1 Employment Area. This area
        represents a logical distribution of the 9,800 SDEs in a manner which makes efficient
        use of the required road and servicing extensions. This area also includes the lands
        required to provide for commercial uses, schools, parks, recreation complexes,
        libraries, police and emergency service needs of the projected population of Phase 1
        in convenient and accessible locations. The location of the initial Phase 1
        Employment Area is located to align with road and servicing extensions through the
        central corridor of Seaton. This location provides the earliest development
        opportunity to closely coincide with development of the Phase 1 Living Areas.

        The subsequent phase(s) of development will expand from the core areas
        established in Phase 1. They will also provide the additional facilities required to
        meet the needs of the additional population added to achieve the initial build-out
        target of 61,000 persons in Seaton.

             The Neighbourhood Plans propose a network of primary and secondary
             recreational trails throughout the Seaton Urban Area, as discussed in the
             Related Studies section above. The Phase 1 primary trail network (also referred
             to as Primary Neighbourhood Connecting Trails as per Pickering OPA 22) and
             corresponding trailheads are shown in Figure 1.1. The trailheads act as
             gateways within each community to the various connecting trails. The
             Landowners will construct the trailheads located within their development
             parcels. The locations of trails and trail heads are subject to change pending
             OMB decisions, and will be addressed through the NFSSR. The necessity, timing,
             and funding of the Primary Neighbourhood Connecting Trails will be
             determined by the Province (OILC), as manager of the NHS, in consultation with
             the City of Pickering and other potentially interested public agencies such as
             TRCA.


        10) Employment Land Servicing

             From the perspective of water and wastewater servicing, the 80 hectare
             Employment lands abutting Highway 407 will be serviced by designated local
             watermains connected to the Zone V pumping station and watermain along
             Sideline 26. Sanitary services are to be made available by the extension of the
             sanitary sewer from the westerly trunk as mentioned in Section 1 above and
             included within the servicing program for the Phase 1 Living Area.

             Access to these employment lands will initially be from Sideline 26 and Highway
             7, and Sideline 24. Interim access to Highway 407 may be provided at the Brock
             Road interchange via Highway 7. The employment collector road along the
             south limit of the development discussed in Section 5 will provide additional
