Noise and Vibration Assessment ­ Proposed 28 Bathurst St. Mixed Use Development 
December 20, 2012 
 

1.0         INTRODUCTION

Novus Environmental Inc. (Novus) was retained by Build Toronto to conduct an Environmental Noise
and Vibration Feasibility Assessment for their proposed mixed use residential development, to be
located at 28 Bathurst Street, in Toronto, Ontario.

1.1     Focus of Report

In keeping with City of Toronto requirements, this report examines the potential for:

        Impacts of the environment on the development;
        Impacts of the development on the environment; and
        Impacts of the development on itself.

1.2     Nature of the Subject Lands

The subject property, 28 Bathurst Street, is currently a vacant lot. The proposal calls for construction
of three new residential towers located on a common mixed-use podium:

        Building 1 is 19 storeys;
        Buildings 2 and 3 will be 16 storeys each.

The site plan of the proposed development is provided in Figures 1a and 1b. Axonometric views of
the proposed development are provided in Figure 1c.

1.3     Nature of the Surroundings

The site is located near the intersection of Front Street and Bathurst Street. A context plan is shown in
Figure 2.

        To the east of the site lies Bathurst Street, and the approved Minto Freed development
        To the south of the site is the Union Station Railway Corridor, beyond which lies Fort York
        To the northwest of the site is the proposed Shimcor "Coffin Lofts" development
        To the west if the site is the Quality Meat Packers facility




 
                                                                                    Novus Environmental | 1

PART 1: IMPACTS OF THE ENVIRONMENT ON THE
        DEVELOPMENT

In assessing the potential for the environment to impact the development, the focus of this report is to
assess the potential for:

     1) Transportation noise impacts from road and rail;
     2) Vibration impacts from rail; and
     3) "Stationary" noise impacts from nearby industrial sources, including Quality Meat Packers.

2.0          Transportation Noise Sources

The following transportation sources have the potential to produce substantial noise levels at the
development:

         The Union Station Railway Corridor (USRC);
         The Gardiner Expressway;
         Bathurst Street; and
         Front Street.

The level of noise from these sources has been predicted, and this information has been used to
identify façade, ventilation and warning clause requirements.

3.0          Transportation Noise Criteria

3.1      Ministry of the Environment Publication LU-131

Ministry of the Environment (MOE) Publication LU-131 contains sound level criteria for new
residential developments:

In addition, the MOE has several different categories of warning clauses to be registered on Title for
residences within new developments, depending on the predicted sound levels and nature of the noise
mitigation requirements.


3.2       Canadian National Railways / GO Transit Guidelines

CN has published updated noise and vibration guidelines for new residential development located
adjacent to their railway corridors. These guidelines have also been adopted by Metrolinx/ GO
Transit. The Union Station Railway Corridor would be classified as a Principal Main Line.
Accordingly, the applicable guideline limits are presented below:

CN and GO also generally require:

         A safety setback of dwellings from the railway rights-of-way to be a minimum of 30 metres in
         conjunction with a safety berm. The safety berm shall be adjoining and parallel to the railway
         rights-of-way with returns at the ends, 2.5 metres above grade at the property line, with side
         slopes not steeper than 2.5 to 1.

         A noise attenuation barrier shall be adjoining and parallel to the railway rights-of-way, having
         returns at the ends, and a minimum total height of 5.5 metres above top-of-rail. Acoustic fence
         to be constructed without openings and of a durable material weighing not less than 20 kg. per
         square metre of surface area. Subject to the review of the noise report, GO Transit may
         consider other measures recommended by an approved Noise Consultant.

         Brick veneer or acoustical equivalent on the first row of housing beside the right ­of-way.

CN also has warning clause requirements.

The CN and GO guideline requirements will be met as follows:

         Upgraded facades will be required for the eastern, western and southern portions of the
         building facing the USRC. Details are discussed in Section 7.

         The safety setback of 25 m will be used for this project, and has been discussed with Metrolinx
         and CN representatives. The setback is provided through a combination of vertical and
         horizontal distance from the right-of-way. This is consistent with approaches previously
         allowed by Metrolinx and CN in estimating setbacks.

         For this particular project, the safety berm will be replaced by a custom-built engineered crash
         wall to be incorporated into the building design. This work is being done by a specialist firm.

         As there is no safety berm adjacent to the tight-of-way, the 5.5 m high barrier cannot be
         provided in this context. Instead, noise barriers and landscape design will be used on the
         proposed outdoor amenity areas to provide the required acoustical protection. Details are
         discussed in Section 9.

4.0          Traffic Data and Future Projections

Road traffic data was obtained from the City of Toronto Data Centre and from the Ontario Ministry of
Transportation. Copies of all traffic data used and calculations can be found in Appendix A. In
estimating year 2023 volumes, A 1.0% growth rate has been assumed, typical for the city core.

Future road traffic sound levels at the proposed development were predicted using the Cadna/A
computer model. Roadways were modelled as line sources of sound, with sound emission rates
calculated using the ORNAMENT algorithms, the road traffic noise model of the MOE. These
predictions were validated and are equivalent to those made using the MOE's ORNAMENT or
STAMSON v5.04 road traffic noise models.

Rail traffic data was obtained from AECOM Engineering Ltd and from Metrolinx/ GO Transit. The
rail traffic data used in the assessment is summarized below

There are no at-grade rail crossings in the immediate vicinity of the location. The tracks are
constructed of continuously welded rail throughout the study area. However, due to the presence of
numerous switches in the area, the tracks were modelled as jointed.

Rail traffic sound levels were predicted using the Cadna/A computer model, in a similar manner as
roadway noise. Rail sound emission rates were calculated using STEAM modelling algorithms
contained in STAMSON v5.04, the computerized noise model of the MOE.

5.0         Other Railway-Related Noise Sources

The following additional noise sources may affect sound levels at the proposed development:

Idling Trains

The Bathurst North Yard is located near the proposed development. Currently this yard is used for
mid-day train storage for up to seven (7) trains. The trains arrive at the yard during the latter half of
the morning peak period (between approximately 7:30am and 9:00am) and depart in the early stages of
the afternoon peak period (between approximately 3:30pm and 5:30pm). The trains travel up to a
maximum speed of 25 km/h (15 mph) in and out of the yard.

Upon arrival in the yard, the locomotives idle for up to approximately 45 minutes before shutting
down. While in storage, light train servicing is undertaken, including interior cleaning and minor
emergent repairs. Climate control systems, which operate using wayside power, remain active during
mid-day storage hours. Engines are started up to two hours prior to departure in the afternoon peak
period. The locomotives are started in order of respective service departure. Therefore, at some point
prior to the departures, all engines may be running simultaneously depending on schedule
requirements. Bells will be used as part of normal operations when trains are moving in and out of the
yard. Other audible signals such as horns may be used in emergency situations. Crews may also
occasionally test audible warning devices as part of the pre-departure inspection. While no formal
plans are in place for overnight train storage at the Bathurst North Yard, the yard may be used for such
as a long term alternative.

Trains enter the yard from the west end, and stop at the east end. As a result, the closest train
locomotives will be located 300 m to 600 m away from proposed development. At these distances
noise impacts from idling locomotives will be significantly lower than levels from trains moving
through the main USRC corridor and from surrounding road traffic. Therefore, adverse noise impacts
from the yard are not anticipated. There are several existing and approved residential developments
closer to the Yard than the proposal.

Snow Clearing Devices

Some critical switches in the vicinity of the Bathurst North Yard are kept clear of snow using
stationary blowers mounted at track level. These blowers are located throughout the corridor to
facilitate train movements in and out of the yard. While noise from the blowers may occasionally be
audible, they will be significantly less than those from trains moving through the main USRC corridor
and from surrounding road traffic. Therefore, adverse noise impacts from the switch blowers are not
anticipated.

Rail Corridor Snow Removal Equipment

Rail corridor snow removal equipment: GO Transit owns a mobile snow blower that may occasionally
be used to clear snow in and around the Bathurst North Yard. Noise from snow clearing activities will
be significantly less than those from trains moving through the main USRC corridor and from
surrounding road traffic. Therefore, adverse noise impacts are not anticipated.

6.0              Projected Sound Levels

Sound levels were predicted at the façades of the residential buildings within the development, and at
points of reception within communal outdoor living areas located at the 3rd and 5th floor podium roofs.
Note that the assessment assumes full build-out of the development (all Phases constructed), and that
all recommended sound barriers are in place.

Predicted façade sound levels at a number of heights above grade are presented in the following
Tables. The location of modelled receptors is shown in Figure 3.

7.0              Façade Recommendations

Upgraded glazing will be required to meet the indoor sound level requirements. Indoor sound levels
and required Facade Sound Transmission Classes (STCs) were estimated using the procedures
outlined in National Research Council Building Practice Note BPN-56.

Preliminary acoustical requirements for curtain wall constructions, at various heights above grade, are
provided below in the tables below.

Detailed floor plans were not available. For the analysis, generic bedrooms and living rooms have
been considered. Living rooms and bedrooms were assumed to be carpeted. Higher STCs would be
required at corner units, where sound may enter the affected space through multiple exposed facades.
Final façade requirements should be confirmed at the site plan stage.

Façade predictions are provided for window wall facades where the window portion is assumed to be
10 %, 20 %, and 30 % of the floor area. An additional analysis is provided where wall portions of the
east, west, and south facades are rated at STC 54, which is acoustically equivalent to brick veneer, and
would therefore meet Metrolinx/ CN requirements. For this scenario, a conservative 30% window to
floor area has been assumed.

Results are summarized in the following Table.

 -   * Can be achieved through brick or masonry exterior façade or equivalent, and drywall on resilient fasteners.
Facades facing the east, west and south will generally require upgraded walls and windows. In
keeping with Metrolinx/ CN requirements, brick or masonry facade or equivalent is recommended for
the wall portions. Required windows will then range from standard OBC windows up to STC 41.

Once detailed floor plans and façade plans become available, the requirements for the glazing should
be reviewed by an Acoustical Consultant.

8.0          Ventilation and Warning Clause Requirements

Central air-conditioning and a warning clause is required for all affected units where the daytime and
night-time sound levels from the combination of roadway and railway traffic exceed 65 and 60 dBA
Leq, respectively. This affects all units with south, east and west facades in all three buildings.

Where the daytime and night-time sound levels from the combination of roadway and railway
roadway traffic exceed 55 and 50 dBA Leq respectively, forced air heating with provisions for future
installation of central air conditioning, and a Warning Clause, are required. This would apply to all
units.

See Appendix B for warning clause details. The warning clauses must be registered on Title and
included in all agreements of purchase and sale or lease and all rental agreements.


9.0          Outdoor Living Area

There are large communal outdoor amenity spaces on the 3rd floor and 5th floor podium roofs. See
Figure 1b. These areas are exposed to traffic noise from the Gardiner Expressway and the USRC.
Predicted sound levels are shown in the following Table:

Table 9:         Outdoor Amenity Space Sound Levels

          Level 5 Podium                              67.8 to 77.7                              62.9 to 67.8 

A 3.0 m high parapet sound barrier located along the southern façade will reduce sound levels to
between 62.9 and 69.1 dBA. The proposed barrier location is shown in Figure 4. Such sound levels
are generally adequate for conversation, but do not meet the guideline objective of 60 dBA (with
warning clause). Higher noise barriers along the parapet edge will not provide sufficient screening to
meet the objective.

Instead, during the site plan stage, the landscape design should include acoustical screening to protect
the designated seating areas on the podiums. Such screening, in combination with the 3.0 m high
parapet wall, should be sufficient to meet the guideline requirements.
The proposed barriers can be composed of solid parapet walls and glass/plexiglass panels. The panels
should be selected so that they have sufficient mass to adequately attenuate the noise (generally a
minimum of 10 kg/m2 face density). The panels and frames should be free of gaps and cracks on the
sides and bottom. The system should also be designed to withstand any wind loading.

10.0        Transportation Vibration Criteria

There are no Ministry of the Environment guidelines with respect to railway vibration for land use
approvals. CN Rail and GO Transit have published their own criteria, and both require that vibration
impact assessments be conducted to ensure that adverse vibration impacts do not occur.

Both CN and GO require the following:

        Ground-borne vibration transmission to be evaluated in a report through site testing to
        determine if dwellings within 75 metres of the railway rights-of-way will be impacted by
        vibration conditions in excess of 0.14 mm/sec RMS between 4 Hz and 200 Hz. The monitoring
        system should be capable of measuring frequencies between 4 Hz and 200 Hz, + 3 dB with an
        RMS averaging time constant of 1 second. If in excess, isolation measures will be required to
        ensure living areas do not exceed 0.14 mm/sec RMS on and above the first floor of the
        dwelling.


10.1 Vibration Measurement Program

Measurements of ground-induced vibration due to rail traffic were made at the existing site.
Measurements were conducted on May 25, 2012. Simultaneous measurements of ground vibrations
were conducted at the edge of the railway right-of-way, and at several setback distances. These are the
closest residential locations, and if the vibration criteria are met here, they will be met at locations
further from the railway line.

Vibration monitoring locations are shown in Figure 5.

Vibration measurements were conducted using a Minimate Pro 4 monitor manufactured by Instantel
Inc. The Minimate Pro 4 system records vibration using a tri-axial velocity transducer. The maximum
RMS vibration level was obtained by post-processing the recorded vibration signals using a MATLAB
data analysis program developed by Novus. The Minimate Pro 4 system was installed at the right-of-
way for all events. The LMS system was used to measure vibrations at setbacks corresponding to the
residential tower footprints.

A total of 36 train events were recorded by the Minimate system at the right-of-way. This included 32
GO Trains, and 4 VIA commuter trains. While no CN freight trains were captured in the



 
                                                                                   Novus Environmental | 11

measurements, the measured GO trains travel on tracks much closer to the proposed site, and at much
higher speeds.

A vibration propagation model was used to predict expected worst-case vibration levels from freight
trains. This approach is consistent with typical acoustical engineering practices. The vibration model
was constructed using the measurements of GO Trains obtained at the various offset distances from
the track shown in Figure 5. The resulting RMS vibration level versus distance curves are shown in
Figure 6, together with the raw measurement data.

10.2 Vibration Prediction Results

A prediction of the worst-case anticipated vibration levels at the 25 m building setback distance was
computed and the most conservative vibration decay curve (95% confidence limit1) as shown in
Figure 6. The predicted worst-case vibration level (95% confidence limit) at the offset distance
corresponding to the closest residential tower (25 m) is 0.11 mm/s RMS, well below the 0.14 mm/s
rms guideline limit.

The predicted vibration velocity is below the 0.14 mm/s criterion and therefore the proposed
residential tower setback complies with the applicable vibration criterion.

10.3 Vibration Control Recommendations

Ground-borne vibration levels are not expected to exceed the applicable criterion at the proposed
development; however, there is potential for vibration energy to enter the portion of the underground
parking structure that abuts the right-of-way. To mitigate this potential impact and eliminate the
possibility of structure-borne vibration transmission to receptors, an isolation joint is recommended (if
feasible) to separate the residential building foundations from the parking structure. The isolation joint
should extend down through all parking levels, severing the transmission path between the rail line
and residential towers.

11.0         Stationary Source Impacts

11.1 Guideline D-6

The D-series of guidelines were developed by the Ontario Ministry of the Environment (MOE) in
1995 as a means to assess recommended separation distances and other control measures for land use
planning proposals in an effort to prevent or minimize `adverse effects' from the encroachment of
incompatible land uses where a facility either exists or is proposed. The guideline specifically
addresses issues of odour, dust, noise and litter.




1
  The decay curve at the "95% confidence limit" means that 95% of all vibration levels would be expected to fall below
this value, asumming that measured vibration levels are normally distributed. Average vibration levels would be much
lower.

To minimize the potential to cause an adverse effect, areas of influence and recommended minimum
setback distances were included within the guidelines. Guideline D-6 "Compatibility Between
Industrial Facilities and Sensitive Land Uses" is specific to industrial uses in proximity to more
sensitive land uses such as the proposed residential development on the subject lands.
The areas of influence and recommended separation distances from the guidelines are provided in the
table below.

11.2 Industrial Facilities In the Area of the Proposed Development

The primary industrial facility in the area which may affect the proposed development is Quality Meat
Packers Ltd. This facility is located directly to the west of the proposed development, and is includes
many sources of noise. The only other facility in the area is the City of Toronto Works Yard (see
Figure 2), which is significantly farther away, and involves activities which inherently produce less
noise. As a result, in assessing potential industrial noise impacts, this report has focused on Quality
Meat Packers operations.

11.3 Quality Meat Packers Operations

        11.3.1 Description of Operations

Quality Meat Packers Limited (which also operates as Toronto Abattoirs Limited) is located at
2 Tecumseth Street, directly to the west of the proposed development. The facility is a hog
slaughtering and meat packing operation, including lard rendering, hog casing, offals, cutting and
boning, pickling and packaging. The general operating schedule includes two production shifts per
day, and night shift sanitation, five days per week.

Live hogs (approximately 5500 per day) are brought to the site via transport truck where they are
unloaded into a `barn' area. Hog receiving and unloading occurs between 7 am and 7 pm. The barn
includes an Ecolo EP-60 barn odour control system, where a masking agent is sprayed into the barn to
mask any unpleasant odours. The barn is maintained to the strict requirements of the Canadian Food
Inspection Agency.

The pigs are then slaughtered, processed and packaged inside the main facility. Odours from the
wastewater system area, sludge tank area, maintenance shop, kill floor and inedible area are ducted
into a chemical scrubber system, which operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Sodium

hypochlorite is used as an odour reagent. During nights and weekends when there is no processing, no
chemicals are applied.

The facility operates under Ministry of the Environment (MOE) Certificate of Approval 6308-
6U9LWD, issued February 9, 2007. The "C of A" is specifically for the odour control equipment.
Conditions in the C of A require: that a maintenance manual be maintained, outlining "all appropriate
measures to minimize noise and odorous emissions from all potential sources"; that the company
record all complaints and notify the MOE District Office; and that the company complete an Acoustic
Assessment Report. A copy of the C of A is included in Appendix C.

A key feature of the Certificate of Approval is Condition 4:

        Condition 4 requires that an Acoustic Assessment Report (AAR) be completed and submitted
        within 3 months, and if required, that at Noise Abatement Action Plan (NAAAP) be completed
        within 9 months of the date of the Certificate (2007)

        Condition 4.1 states that if the AAR finds the facility does not comply with Publication NPC-
        205 noise guideline limits, then the NAAP must be filed, showing the required noise control
        measures to ensure compliance, the timetable for implementation, and the timetable for
        additional assessments.

Although the AAR and NAAP should have been long completed, there was no record of such included
in the Freedom of Information Request materials provided by the Ministry.

The MOE has conducted several site inspections over the years, the most recent (at time of writing)
being on April 18, 2012. A copy of the "Record of Site Visit" is also included in Appendix C. The
facility was found to be in compliance.

        11.3.2 Complaint History

Based on a Freedom of Information (FOI) request submitted to the Ministry of the Environment
(MOE), the Quality Meat Packers facility has been the subject of 31 odour complaints since 1989,
with the majority of the complaints occurring within the last decade. There have been no noise-related
complaints. No abatement actions were required by the MOE as a result of any of the complaints.

11.4 Industrial Classification of the Quality Meats Facility

Based on the D-6 Guidelines, the Quality Meat Packers facility has qualities of both Class II and Class
III facilities. As shown in Table 10, the area of influence for a Class II facility is 300 m and the
recommended setback distance is 70 m.

Table 10 shows that the proposed development is within both the recommended minimum setback
distance and area of influence of the Quality Meat Packers facility. Section 4.10 of Guideline D-6
states that minimum setback distances as set out in the guideline may not be achievable for areas of
redevelopment, infilling and mixed uses. Section 4.10.3 of Guideline D-6 states that in this case,

feasibility analysis should be completed to determine the appropriateness of the adjoining land uses.
This report is meant to satisfy this requirement.

11.5 MOE LU-131 Guidelines for Stationary Noise Sources

MOE noise guidelines for stationary source noise impacting residential developments are given in
MOE publication LU-131 "Noise Assessment Criteria in Land Use Planning." LU-131 stationary
source noise requirements are summarized below:

The acoustic environment surrounding the proposed development is dominated by the roadway noise
and a general urban hum during all periods of the day. Therefore, the proposed development is
considered to be located in a Class 1 area, and an assessment of impacts was completed for the
daytime (0700h to 2300h) and night-time (2300h to 0700h) periods.

The LU-131 guideline limits are generally consistent with those in MOE Publication NPC-205, which
applies to Quality Meat Packers operations under their Certificate of Approval:

the premises of a person where sound or 
  vibration originating from other than          Evening        47;      or the background due to road traffic, 
       those premises is received.            (19002300h)                     whichever is higher.

Since the ambient sound levels were anticipated to exceed the LU-131 / NPC-205 default limits, sound
exposures from roadway noise were assessed and the corresponding applicable guideline limits were
determined. Roadway noise was modelled as line sources of sound using the Cadna/A computer
model. Sound emission rates were calculated using the ORNAMENT algorithms contained in
STAMSON v5.04, the road traffic noise model of the MOE. The Cadna/A noise predictions were then
calibrated against STAMSON v5.04 sound level predictions. The minimum hourly Leq for the
ambient sound levels were found to exceed the LU-131 default guideline limits for both the daytime
(0700h to 2300h) and night-time (2300h to 0700h) periods for all receptor locations.

11.6 City of Toronto Noise Bylaw

The provisions of the City of Toronto Noise Bylaw (Municipal Code Chapter 591, as amended) also
apply to Quality Meat Packers operations.

Section 591-2 sets out general prohibitions against creating noise likely to disturb the inhabitants of
the City.

Section 591-4 provides prohibitions by time and place for certain activities. Noise from these
activities is prohibited if it is clearly audible at a point of reception in a residential area:

        Loading, unloading, delivering, packing, unpacking, or otherwise handling any containers,
        products or materials.

        Prohibited between 11:00 pm one day to 7:00 am the next day, 9:00 am Sundays and statutory
        holidays

While no definition of "clearly audible" exists, the approach which has been taken in the past, and at
the specific approved developments in the area, is that if the Ministry of the Environment criteria are
met (through at source or receptor-based noise mitigation), then the "clearly audible" criteria in the
bylaw are met.

Section 591-5 sets out general limitations on sound levels due to stationary sources. This section
adopts MOE Publication NPC-205 guideline limits as a City bylaw requirement.

11.7 Industrial "Stationary Source" Noise Modelling

Site visits were conducted on May 25, May 30 and June 7, 2012. The presence of noisy activities was
noted, and spot measurements were conducted. A review of aerial photographs was also conducted to
identify the location of noise sources of concern on building rooftops. Information on Quality Meat
Packers operations obtained through Freedom of Information request was also reviewed.
The primary noise sources of concern are:

        Rooftop ventilation equipment, chillers, evaporative condensers and cooling towers
        Refrigeration shipping trucks and trailers when parked on property
        The odour scrubbing system

Modelled source locations are shown in Figure 8. Sound power data for the equipment was estimated
based on the measurements and from data from previous projects. A summary of data can be found in
Appendix D.

The general operating schedule includes two production shifts per day, and night shift sanitation, five
days per week. This is consistent with the Noise By-law restrictions on loading and unloading during
overnight periods. As a result, it is assumed that refrigeration shipping trucks are not present during
the overnight period.

Noise levels at existing residences and at the proposed development were modelling using Cadna/A, a
computerized implementation of the ISO 9613 noise propagation algorithms. This is the preferred
noise model of the MOE. The model accounts for attenuation due to distance; directionality;
screening from terrain and buildings; ground absorption; and atmospheric effects.

        11.7.1 Modelling Results

Noise levels were modelled at representative worst-case existing receptors. See Figure 8 for modelled
receptor locations. Results are shown in the following Table:

Predicted sound levels from the Quality Meats facility exceed the applicable NPC-205 noise guideline
limits at surrounding existing residential receptors.

Noise levels at the proposed 28 Bathurst St development were then predicted. The results in terms of
excesses over the applicable guideline limit are presented graphically in Figures 9 and 10, and are

           11.7.2 Discussion

Predicted sound levels from the Quality Meats facility exceed the applicable NPC-205 noise guideline
limits at surrounding existing residential receptors. Under the terms and conditions of their Certificate
of Approval, Quality Meat Packers has an existing obligation to reduce its sound emissions so that the
guideline limits are met at all existing residences. Currently, the night-time guideline limits are
exceeded by up 14 dB at existing receptors.

Under Condition 4.1 of their Certificate of Approval, Quality Meats is obligated to develop a Noise
Abatement Action Plan to bring their facility into compliance with NPC-205 limits, through
implementing process changes and adding noise mitigation measures, such as silencers (mufflers),
noise barriers, enclosures, or changes/ upgrades to equipment.

Should Quality Meat Packers meet their obligations and mitigate their operations to meet the guideline
limits at existing receptors, then the guidelines will also be met at the proposed development, as shown
in Figure 11 and Table 15.

 Notes: All values are Leq (1 hr) sound exposures, in dBA, and are the difference between the facility noise level and the
        applicable guideline limit.

Regardless, other methods are available for noise mitigation under the applicable Publication LU-131
guidelines, to address the impacts on the proposed development. These can be addressed during site
plan approval stage.


           11.7.3 Recommended Warning Clause

A warning clause should be registered on Title, and included in the Agreement of Purchase and Sale
or Lease and in the relevant Development Agreements. An MOE LU-131 Type E warning clause is
required for the Phase 1 units. See Appendix B for warning clause details.

PART 2: IMPACTS OF THE DEVELOPMENT ON ITSELF

12.0         Outdoor Noise Impacts From Ventilation Sources

The building ventilation and potential emergency systems associated with the development have not
been designed at this time. Such equipment has the potential to result in noise impacts on residential
spaces within the development itself.

12.1 Applicable Guideline Limits

On- and off-site noise impacts from all mechanical equipment, including but not limited to any
required chillers, cooling towers, exhaust fans, and make up air handling units, should comply with the
guideline limits contained in:

         The City of Toronto Municipal Code, Chapter 591: Noise; and
         MOE Publication NPC-205.

These criteria generally limit noise from stationary sources relative to the ambient sound exposures.

Table 16:        NPC-205 and City of Toronto Noise Guideline Limits for Stationary
                 Noise (Non-Impulsive Noise Sources)

                                               Sound Level Limit (Leq 1hr, dBA), During Time Period* 
        Type of Space                   Daytime                         Evening                      Nighttime

     Outdoor Living Area                    50                             47                             45

      Sleeping Quarters                     50                             47                             45 
Notes:
*    Or the minimum hourly background sound level Leq(l), whichever is higher.
 - Leq. measured in A-weighted decibels (dBA), is the value of the constant sound level which would result in exposure
    to the same total sound energy as would the specified time-varying sound, if constant sound level persisted over an
    equal time interval.

Impacts for living and sleeping areas are evaluated at the outside plane of window.

12.2 Building Equipment

The proposed development will require mechanical ventilation, and may require emergency power
systems. Based on our experience, the type and size of the units which will likely be required, and
their probable location (tower rooftops well removed from on-site and off-site noise sensitive
receptors) adverse noise impacts are not anticipated.



 
 
Novus Environmental | 20 
Noise and Vibration Assessment ­ Proposed 28 Bathurst St. Mixed Use Development 
December 20, 2012 
 

Regardless, potential impacts should be assessed as part of the final building design. The criteria can
be met at all surrounding and on-site receptors by the appropriate selection of mechanical equipment,
by locating equipment with sufficient setback from noise sensitive locations, and by incorporating
control measures (e.g., silencers) into the design.

An Environmental Compliance Approval (ECA) should be applied for with the Ministry of the
Environment at the site plan approval stage, once building mechanical systems are fully designed.
Alternatively, the equipment should be designed to meet the requirements of the applicable
Environmental Activity and Sector Registry (EASR), and be registered with the MOE.

13.0        Interior Noise Sources

Building rooms or spaces next to mechanical equipment areas may be adversely affected by sound
transmitted through ducts, opening, or noise induced by the vibrations of adjoining walls. The isolation
of sound from mechanical equipment can be readily achieved by good design.

All supply, return and miscellaneous fans should be provided with adequate vibration isolation to
ensure that vibration is not transferred to the building structure and become a source of noise. Duct
silencers can be used to ensure that high fan noise levels are not carried by the duct work to residential
and other noise sensitive rooms throughout the building. Fans should be connected to ducting with
flexible connectors. Duct work should be hung on vibration isolating hangers.

All chillers, compressor and similar items of equipment should be provided with adequate vibration
isolation and mounted on concrete inertia bases. The chiller room may need a floating floor or other
alternate acoustically equivalent "room to room" construction to ensure that the high sound levels
associated with a chiller are not transmitted to the residential units.

All piping runs within the building are potential sources of noise. For example, plumbing can be a
source of noise particularly if the source is not in the same suite as the listener. Pipes that pass through
walls, floors and ceiling should be treated to reduce potential noise and vibration impacts. For
example, pipes should be hung on vibration isolating hangers, and risers should not be rigidly
connected to the floors or other supporting members at anchor locations.

Pumps should be provided with adequate vibration isolation and mounted on concrete inertia bases
where required. Transformers and other vibration noise producing electrical components should be
provided with adequate vibration isolation.

The following Table indicates accepted guidelines to limit interior sound levels from continuous
building services (i.e., pumps, air handling units, etc.). These guidelines are in the form of Noise
Criteria (NC) curves, which indicate the maximum desirable sound level at the receptor in different
frequency bands depending on the use of the space.

13.1 Interior Walls and Floors

Walls and floors separating mechanical rooms, fan rooms, electrical rooms, elevators shafts and
rooms, garbage chutes, retail spaces etc. from residential spaces in the building should have adequate
sound transmission loss. The Building Code requires a minimum Sound Transmission Class (STC) of
55 for such floors and walls.

Interior walls between adjacent residential units should have a sufficient sound transmission loss. A
minimum STC of 50 to 55 is recommended between adjacent units, STC-50 being specified by the
Ontario Building Code. Adequate sound isolation can only be achieved if pertinent details to design
and construction are followed. For example, closure of all cracks by caulking or equivalent, and the
sealing of all wall penetrations, including electrical outlets. Electrical outlets serving different suites
should not be within the same stud space or masonry cavity.

Attention should also be paid to the effect of party rooms and other recreational and utility areas
located adjacent to, or in close proximity to, residential units and office spaces. Noise and vibration
impacts due to these areas should be investigated, and noise and/or vibration control measures
included as necessary.

An important aspect not addressed by the Building Code is impact sound. The floor/ceiling systems
can be designed to minimize the transmission of impact sounds. The use of carpet or resilient
underlayments to meet Impact Insulation Class (IIC) ratings of IIC 55-60 would be appropriate for
stacking residential suites.

PART 3: IMPACTS OF THE DEVELOPMENT ON THE
        SURROUNDING AREA

14.0        Impacts of the Development on Surrounding Properties

In terms of the noise environment of the area, it is expected that the project will have a negligible
effect on the neighbouring properties.


 
 
Novus Environmental | 22 
Noise and Vibration Assessment ­ Proposed 28 Bathurst St. Mixed Use Development 
December 20, 2012 
 

14.1 Road Traffic Noise

The traffic related to the proposed development will be small relative to the existing traffic volumes
within the area, and is not of concern with respect to noise impact.

14.2 Ventilation System Noise

Other possible sources of noise associated with the proposed Amexon development which may affect
the surrounding neighbourhood are emergency generators and mechanical roof-top equipment. This
equipment must meet the following requirements at the closest off-site noise sensitive receptors:

        The City of Toronto Municipal Code, Chapter 591: Noise; and
        MOE Publication NPC-205;

Off-site impacts are not anticipated given the high ambient sound levels in the area, the large
separation distances to off-site noise sensitive receptors, and the fact that the systems will be designed
to ensure that the applicable noise guidelines are met at on-site receptors.

Regardless, potential impacts will be assessed as part of the final building design to ensure
compliance. The criteria can be met at all surrounding and on-site receptors though the use of routine
mitigation measures, including the appropriate selection of mechanical equipment, by locating
equipment with sufficient setback from noise sensitive locations, and by incorporating control
measures (e.g., silencers) into the design. An Environmental Compliance Approval (ECA) should be
applied for with the Ministry of the Environment at the site plan approval stage, once building
mechanical systems are fully designed. Alternatively, the equipment should be designed to meet the
requirements of the applicable Environmental Activity and Sector Registry (EASR), and be registered
with the MOE.

15.0        CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The potential for noise and vibration impacts on and from the proposed Amexon Central Park
development have been assessed. Impacts of the environment on the development, the development
on itself, and the development on the surrounding area have been considered. Based on the results of
our studies, the following conclusions have been reached:

15.1 Transportation Noise

     A preliminary assessment of transportation noise impacts has been completed.

     Facade walls and windows may require acoustical upgrades in areas, as outlined in Section 7.

     Central air-conditioning and a warning clause is required for all units with south, east and west
     facades in all three buildings. All other units must have forced air heating with provisions for
     future installation of central air conditioning, and a Warning Clause.


 
                                                                                    Novus Environmental | 23 
                                 Noise and Vibration Assessment ­ Proposed 28 Bathurst St. Mixed Use Development 
                                                                                               December 20, 2012 
 

     A 3.0 m high noise barrier is required along the southern perimeter of the podium outdoor amenity
     areas. In addition, at site plan approval, the landscape design should include noise screening at
     designated seating areas. A warning clause is required.

     Warning Clauses are outlined in Appendix B. The warning clauses must be registered on Title and
     included in all agreements of purchase and sale or lease and all rental agreements.

15.2 Transportation Vibration

     A preliminary assessment of transportation vibration impacts has been completed. Rail vibration
     measurements of existing activities were conducted. This information was used to develop a
     prediction model of vibration level versus distance from the track.

     Based on a combination of measurement and modelling, vibration levels are anticipated to comply
     with CN/GO guidelines. Vibration impacts within the residential portions of the development
     were not predicted, as detailed in Section 10.

     A construction break, however, is recommended to sever the parking garage structure that abuts
     the right-of-way from the residential towers, to ensure that structure-borne vibration is not
     transmitted.

15.3 Industrial "Stationary" Noise

     Quality Meat Packers has been identified as a potential source of concern. An assessment of noise
     impacts has been conducted.

     Predicted sound levels from the Quality Meats facility exceed the applicable NPC-205 noise
     guideline limits at surrounding existing residential receptors. Under the terms and conditions of
     their Certificate of Approval, Quality Meat Packers has an existing obligation to reduce its sound
     emissions so that the guideline limits are met at all existing residences. Currently, the night-time
     guideline limits are exceeded by up 14 dB at existing receptors.

     Under Condition 4.1 of their Certificate of Approval, Quality Meats is obligated to develop a
     Noise Abatement Action Plan to bring their facility into compliance with NPC-205 limits, through
     implementing process changes and adding noise mitigation measures, such as silencers (mufflers),
     noise barriers, enclosures, or changes/ upgrades to equipment.

     The daytime noise guideline limits are met at all points of reception on the proposed development

     The night-time noise guideline limits are met at all points of reception on the proposed
     development, with the exception of the north façade of Building 3, where excesses of up to 4 dB
     may occur.




 
 
Novus Environmental | 24 
Noise and Vibration Assessment ­ Proposed 28 Bathurst St. Mixed Use Development 
December 20, 2012 
 

     Should Quality Meat Packers meet their obligations and mitigate their operations to meet the
     guideline limits at existing receptors, then the guidelines will also be met at the proposed
     development.

     Regardless, the applicable Publication LU-131 noise guidelines allow for receptor-based noise
     mitigation measures, which could be used on the proposed development to address impacts. These
     can be addressed during site plan approval stage.

     As a result, the proposed development is feasible from a stationary noise impact perspective.

     A noise warning clause is recommended. See Appendix B.

15.4 Overall

     Impacts of the environment on the development can be adequately controlled through the feasible
     mitigation measures, façade designs, and warning clauses detailed in this report.

     Impacts of the development on itself are anticipated to be negligible, and can be adequately
     controlled by following the design guidance outlined in Part 2 of this report.

     Impacts of the development on the surrounding area are anticipated to be negligible, and can be
     adequately controlled by following the design guidance outlined in Part 3 of this report.

     Given the early stage of design and the conservative analysis that has been completed, the
     acoustical requirements above should be refined by an Acoustical Consultant as part of the future
     site plan approval application.

Hi Scott - The rail corridor adjacent to the subject site carries rail traffic associated with the Lakeshore West, Milton,
Georgetown and Barrie GO lines. Preliminary midterm (2021 +/-) weekday commuter train volumes at this location are in
the order of 408 trains (319 day, 89 night). Trains will be comprised of a single locomotive and up to 12 passenger cars.

In addition to GO rail traffic, Airport Rail Link trains will also travel on this section of the rail corridor. Preliminary midterm
(2021 +/-) weekday volumes at this location are in the order of 140 trains (128 day, 12 night).

I note that these operational parameters are subject to change and may be influenced by passenger demand and funding
availability.

The maximum passenger train speed in this area is 97 kph (60 mph).

As you mention, the site is also in close proximity to the Bathurst North Yard. Currently this yard is used for mid-day train
storage for up to seven (7) trains. The trains arrive at the yard during the latter half of the morning peak period (between
approximately 7:30am and 9:00am) and depart in the early stages of the afternoon peak period (between approximately
3:30pm and 5:30pm). The trains travel up to a maximum speed of 25 kph (15mph) in and out of the yard. Upon arrival in
the yard, the locomotives idle for up to approximately 45 minutes before shutting down. While in storage, light train
servicing is undertaken, including interior cleaning and minor emergent repairs. Climate control systems, which operate
using wayside power, remain active during mid-day storage hours. Engines are started up to two hours prior to departure
in the afternoon peak period. The locomotives are started in order of respective service departure. Therefore, at some
point prior to the departures, all engines may be running simultaneously depending on schedule requirements. Bells will
be used as part of normal operations when trains are moving in and out of the yard. Other audible signals such as horns
may be used in emergency situations. Crews may also occasionally test audible warning devices as part of the pre-
departure inspection. While no formal plans are in place for overnight train storage at the Bathurst North Yard, the ability
to store GO trains overnight at the Bathurst North Yard should be considered in the noise study as a long term
alternative. For overnight train storage, a similar start-up/shutdown idling pattern for the start and finish of the service day
will occur. Audible safety warning checks may also be conducted at this time. An energy management system will be
used to control the overnight on-board climate. Other noise-related operational matters in the area include:
*General train idling: On occasion trains on regular service will idle in the corridor waiting to access Union Station. This is
particularly common during peak morning and afternoon periods.
*Snow clearing devices at powered switches: Some critical switches in the vicinity of the Bathurst North Yard are kept
clear of snow using stationary blowers mounted at track level. These blowers are located throughout the corridor to
facilitate train movements in and out of the yard. The study should consider and/or comment on the potential noise
implications associated with this equipment.
*Rail corridor snow removal equipment: GO Transit owns a mobile snow blower that may occasionally be used to clear
snow in and around the Bathurst North Yard. The study should consider and/or comment on the potential noise
implications associated with this aspect of the rail operations.

I trust that this information is useful. Please let me know if you need anything else.

Adam

Adam, 
 
Have you had a chance to pull anything together for this request?  We already have the data from CN / AECOM, we just 
need the volumes for GO.  Please advise.

Subject: Request for GO Train Volumes

Adam, 
 
We are beginning a new project near the Toronto railway lands, to be located near the intersection of Bathurst and 
Front St.  The project is near the GO layover yard.   
 
Please provide the usual train forecast data, so we can conduct the required noise and vibration assessments.  I am in 
contact with Warren at AECOM to get the CN data.

Dear Scott:


Project No: 60114380-0800-12-24
Regarding: Train Traffic Data ­ Union Station Rail Corridor (USRC) at the intersection of Bathurst
           Street and Front Street ­ Approximately at Mile 1.10W

The following is provided in response to your May 14th, 2012 request for information regarding rail traffic
at the intersection of Bathurst Street and Front Street, at approximately Mile 1.10W Union Station Rail
Corridor (USRC).

Typical daily traffic volumes are recorded below. However, traffic volumes may fluctuate due to overall
economic conditions, varying traffic demands, weather conditions, track maintenance programs, statutory
holidays and traffic detours that when required may be heavy although temporary.

Typical daily traffic volumes at this site location are as follows:
*Maximum train speed is given in Miles per Hour

The volumes recorded reflect eastbound and westbound freight, way freight and passenger operations on
the USRC. Not included in the above data are CPR and GO Transit commuter trains running east and
west on the USRC. For more information regarding existing and projected commuter operations, Mr.
Adam Snow, Transportation Planner, should be contacted directly through Metrolinx offices at 20 Bay
Street, Suite 600, Toronto, Ontario M5J 2W3, Fax 416-869-1563 and phone 416-869-3600.

Except where anti-whistling bylaws are in effect, engine-warning whistles and bells are normally sounded
at all at-grade crossings. There is one at-grade crossing in the immediate vicinity of the study area,
Strachan Avenue (Mile 1.59). Anti-whistling bylaws are in effect at this crossing location. Please note that
engine warning whistles may be sounded in cases of emergency, as a safety and or warning precaution
at station locations and pedestrian crossings and occasionally for operating requirements.

With respect to equipment restrictions, the gross weight of the heaviest permissible car is 286,000 lbs.
The mainline tracks of the USRC are constructed of bolted rail throughout the study area.

The presence of numerous nearby switches will exacerbate the noise and vibration caused by train
movements. The train station (Union Station) in the vicinity of your site of study may result in exposure
to prolonged exposure to locomotive engine noise. The Bathurst North Equipment Storage Yard in close
proximity to your study may also result in exposure to prolonged exposure to locomotive engine noise.

The Canadian National Railway continues to be strongly opposed to locating developments near railway
facilities and rights-of-way due to potential safety and environmental conflicts. Development adjacent to
the Railway Right-of-Way is not appropriate without sound impact mitigation measures to reduce the
incompatibility. For confirmation of the applicable rail noise, vibration and safety standards, Mr. Nick
Coleman, Canadian National Railway Properties at 905-760-5007 should be contacted directly.

We trust the above information will satisfy your current request.


Sincerely,
AECOM Canada Ltd.

development and individual dwelling(s).  Metrolinx will not be responsible for any complaints or 
claims arising from use of such facilities and/or operations on, over or under the aforesaid right
