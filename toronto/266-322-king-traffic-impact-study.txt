Dear Mr. Kofman:

Subject:       Transportation Impact, Site Circulation and Parking Study
               266-322 King Street West
               City of Toronto

MMM Group Limited is pleased to present the findings of our Transportation Impact, Site Circulation
and Parking Study related to the proposed development to be located at 266-322 King Street West in
the City of Toronto.

The findings indicate that the projected traffic volumes associated with the proposed development will
not materially impact the boundary roadways in the vicinity of the site. The findings further indicate
that the low parking supply proposed for the development is reasonable given the location of the site
itself, its proximity to excellent transit service, as well as pedestrian and cycling facilities.

We thank you for the opportunity to undertake this study. We would be pleased to respond to any
questions should they arise.

Yours very truly,

MMM GROUP LIMITED

1.0      INTRODUCTION

         MMM Group Limited (MMM) was retained by Projectcore Inc. on behalf of Ed Mirvish
         Enterprises Limited to undertake a Transportation Impact, Site Circulation and Parking
         Study in support of the proposed mixed-use development to be located on the northeast
         corner of John Street and King Street West, extending to just east of Ed Mirvish Way
         along King Street, in the City of Toronto. The location of the proposed development and
         the study area are illustrated in Figure 1.1.

         The development at Nos. 266 to 322 King Street West is proposed to consist of three
         residential towers and a mixed-use podium complex that will include the following:

                   2,709 residential condominium units;
                   Retail space totalling 112,591 ft2 (10,460 m2);
                   Office space totalling 48,545 ft2 (4,510 m2);
                   A 62,323 ft2 (5,790 m2) art gallery; and
                   A 22,440 ft2 (2,080 m2) Ontario College of Art & Design (OCAD) campus.

         Vehicular access to and from the development will be provided via Pearl Street for the
         two west towers, and via Ed Mirvish Way for the east tower. Additionally, the
         development is immediately adjacent to TTC streetcar service on King Street, and well
         within reasonable walking distance to subway service via the St. Andrew Station. The
         layout of the development is illustrated on the site plan in Figure 1.2.

2.0      EXISTING TRAFFIC CONDITIONS

2.1      Boundary Road Network

         The following roadways make up the boundary road network that surrounds the subject
         site. All of these roadways have posted speed limits of 50km/h:

              King Street West is a four-lane east-west major arterial road, with streetcar service
              in the median lanes. During peak hours, these lanes are reserved for streetcar and
              taxi use only, leaving only one general purpose lane in each direction;
              John Street is a north-south collector road that has a four-lane cross-section;
              Adelaide Street West is a local eastbound collector road with a four-lane cross-
              section;
              Simcoe Street is a three-lane southbound local roadway located to the east of the
              proposed development;
              Wellington Street West is a four-lane east-west local roadway to the south of the
              proposed development;
              Pearl Street is a two-lane westbound laneway connecting York Street to John
              Street; and
              Duncan Street/Ed Mirvish Way is a two-lane north-south local roadway connecting
              King Street West to Queen Street West.

         The study area includes the following signalized intersections:

              King Street West at John Street;
              King Street West at Simcoe Street;
              Adelaide Street West at John Street;
              Adelaide Street West at Simcoe Street;
              Adelaide Street West at Duncan Street;
              Wellington Street West at John Street; and
              Wellington Street West at Simcoe Street.

         The following unsignalized intersections are also included:

              King Street West at Ed Mirvish Way;
              Simcoe Street at Pearl Street;
              John Street at Pearl Street; and
              Duncan Street at Pearl Street.

         The lane configurations at all signalized and unsignalized intersections are illustrated in
         Figure 2.1.

         The existing traffic data provides a "snapshot" of roadway conditions during the weekday
         a.m. and p.m. peak periods. All turning movement counts are included in Appendix A.

         In addition to this information, signal timing information was available from MMM's
         database for all study area intersections along Wellington Street and King Street.
         However, signal timing information on Adelaide Street was not available from the City at
         the time of writing. As a result, we have assumed that Adelaide Street has a common
         cycle length of 70 seconds with both King Street and Wellington Street. The splits on
         Adelaide were optimized based on the existing volumes.

2.3      Existing Public Transit Service

         The study area is well served by TTC transit service. A summary of the streetcar and
         subway routes operating on King Street and out of the St. Andrew TTC Station are
         provided below in Table 2.2. An illustration of local transit service is shown in Figure
         2.2. The information provided is current as of September 2012.

         The transit service that is provided in the area will be directly available to residents,
         visitors, patrons and tenants of the proposed development. The underground PATH
         system is accessible via 225 King Street West which is located immediately across from
         the subject development and connects to the St. Andrew Station, as well as many
         Toronto landmarks and attractions.

2.4      Methodology

         In order to analyze existing traffic conditions on the boundary road network, the traffic
         counts were balanced and adjusted to more accurately reflect actual traffic volumes.
         Intersection delay, progression, queuing and capacity analyses were undertaken using
         the Synchro 8 traffic simulation software. This software incorporates the methodology
         outlined in the Highway Capacity Manual, Transportation Research Board, 2010. The
         simulation software allows for a credible replication of signal operations and high
         vehicular volumes in the network, as well as the peaking characteristics of traffic in the
         rest of the study area during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours.

         The Level of Service definitions for signalized and unsignalized intersections are
         included in Appendix B.

2.5      Existing Traffic Conditions

         The City of Toronto Synchro 7 Guidelines (April 22, 2010) were referenced to calibrate
         the existing conditions. This included a lost time adjustment of -1.0 seconds for all
         movements, modifications to the lane widths, and the application of the "Central
         Business District" area-type.

         The operations of the study area intersections were analyzed based on the lane
         configurations shown in Figure 2.1 and the traffic volumes illustrated in Figure 2.3.
         Signal timing plans for the intersections on King and Wellington Streets were available
         from previous work completed by MMM. However, timing plans for Adelaide Street
         could not be obtained at the time this report was completed. As a result, we have
         assumed a common cycle length of 70 seconds on Adelaide Street, which is the same
         as that on King and Wellington, and have optimized the splits based on the observed
         volumes. Table 2.3 summarizes the existing traffic conditions and detailed capacity
         analysis sheets are included in Appendix C.

         Notes:   1. Critical movements are those with a volume-to-capacity ratio exceeding 0.90 for a signalized intersection or
                  with a LOS of `E' or `F' for an unsignalized intersection.
                  2. The LOS at an unsignalized intersection is defined by the movement with the highest delay.

3.0      SITE-GENERATED TRAFFIC

3.1      Trip Generation

         The trip generation for the proposed development has been determined through the use
         of ITE's Trip Generation, 8th Edition as well as the 2006 Transportation Tomorrow
         Survey (TTS). A two step approach was used: firstly, the number of trips for each land
         use was estimated using the rates from Trip Generation. Once these trips were
         determined, they were then reduced to account for both the anticipated trip synergies
         from the mixed-use components of the site, as well as the significant differences in
         modal split between the sites used in Trip Generation and the proposed downtown
         location of this site.

         The gross trip generation, multi-use share factors, modal split percentages and net site
         trips are shown in the below Tables 3.1 to 3.4.

The art gallery use has not been included in the trip generation due to a lack of information
available on the intended market and clientele, which will greatly affect the trip generation of this
use. Given that a total of between 1,000 and 2,000 gross trips are expected to be generated by
this site, we do not believe that the gallery will be a significant contributor of trips to the overall
development.

         It should be noted that the number of trips projected for the site are higher than the total
         number of parking spaces being provided on site. While it is unlikely that parking space
         turnover will be as the number of net trips suggests, it can be assumed that this would
         be a worst case scenario in terms of trips from the site, regardless of the number of
         parking spaces that will be ultimately provided.

3.2      Trip Distribution

         The projected distribution for the trips generated by the various uses of the proposed
         East and West blocks of the development is based on 2006 TTS data. The distribution
         data was then used to determine the ratio of site traffic expected to use each of the
         gateways in the study area. Due to various turn restrictions and one-way streets,
         separate trip distributions were determined for the east and west blocks. The overall trip
         distribution to each of the gateways for each block, for the a.m. and p.m. peak hours, is
         shown below in Tables 3.5 and 3.6.

         estimated trip generation shown in Table 3.2, and the trip distribution in Table 3.3. The
         trip assignment to the road network is based on the assumption that traffic will seek the
         shortest routes or the "path of least resistance" in terms of available road capacity and
         delays. The site generated trips for the development are illustrated in Figure 3.1.

4.0      FUTURE BACKGROUND TRAFFIC CONDITIONS

         A review of the future background developments in the study area was conducted using
         the City of Toronto's Development Application Database, in order to determine the
         expected future background traffic conditions. A list of the background developments
         can be found in section 4.1.

         Given that traffic volumes are generally stagnant in the downtown core, with the majority
         of increased volumes resulting from background developments, we have not applied a
         growth rate on arterial roadways in the study area.

4.1      Background Developments

         The background developments that were considered as a part of the background traffic
         for this study are listed below in Table 4.1. Each of the developments is described along
         with approximate site statistics for each of the sites.

         The trip generation for each of these developments was generated using the same rates
         as those for the proposed site. They were then distributed and assigned according to the
         trip distribution detailed in Sections 3.2 and 3.3. The resulting development volumes are
         shown in Figures 4.1 to 4.4.

4.2      Future Background Traffic Analysis

         The future background development volumes were added to the existing traffic volumes,
         and are illustrated in Figure 4.5 respectively. For the 2017 future background analysis,
         the signal timings for all signalized intersections were optimized and coordinated, while
         maintaining the same cycle lengths. The results of the operational assessments are
         summarized in Table 4.2. Detailed intersection capacity analyses are included in
         Appendix E.

         Notes:   1. Critical movements are those with a volume-to-capacity ratio exceeding 0.90 for a signalized intersection or
                  with a LOS of `E' or `F' for an unsignalized intersection.
                  2. The LOS at an unsignalized intersection is defined by the movement with the highest delay.
                  3. Unsignalized intersection results determined using HCM2010 methodology

              Similar to existing conditions, all the intersections are expected to operate at
              acceptable levels of service with moderate delays.

5.0      TOTAL FUTURE TRAFFIC CONDITIONS

         This section describes the expected impacts resulting from the addition of the site-
         generated traffic to the future background traffic volumes. The traffic volumes for the
         total future traffic condition are illustrated in Figure 5.1. Again, the signal timings and
         phasing structure for all signalized intersections have been optimized and coordinated.
         The results of the operational assessments are summarized in Table 5.1. Detailed
         intersection capacity analyses are included in Appendix F.

              For the total future conditions, some intersections in the immediate vicinity of the
              development such as John/King and Simcoe/King are expected to have their LOS
              decrease to `D' during the p.m. peak hour, with some movements approaching or
              operating at capacity.
              At the Ed Mirvish Way/Pearl Street intersection the LOS decreases to E, with 37
              seconds of delay and no critical movements.
              All other intersections are expected to operate at acceptable levels of service with
              moderate delays.

6.0      PARKING ASSESSMENT

The development at Nos. 266 to 322 King Street West is proposed to include a total of 311
parking spaces comprised of 219 residential and 92 non-residential spaces for the three towers.
In addition, approximately 1,824 bicycle parking spaces are proposed for the development. The
proposed parking ratio is approximately 0.08 resident spaces/unit and 0.03 non-residential
spaces/100 m2.

The City of Toronto Zoning By-law No. 1156-2010 was used to determine the required parking
spaces. Using the criteria set out in the By-law, the development requires a minimum of:

         1,653 resident spaces (0.3, 0.5, 0.8 and 1.0 space per bachelor, 1-bedroom, 2-bedroom
         and 3-bedroom, respectively);
         270 visitor parking spaces (0.1 space per unit);
         104 retail parking spaces (1 space per 100 m2);
         15 office parking spaces (0.35 spaces per 100 m2);
         28 gallery parking spaces (0.5 spaces per 100 m2); and
         2 OCAD parking spaces (0.1 spaces per 100 m2).

Based on the Zoning By-law, the development requires 2,072 vehicle parking spaces. Thus, the
development is deficient by 1,761 spaces. Furthermore, the ZBL requires approximately 2,813
bicycle parking spaces, though this number is conservative since gross floor areas were used in
lieu of internal floor areas of the retail, education and office components of the site.

Although the parking for this development is deficient, the development's unique location at King
and John, plus the available carshare services and its proximity to the streetcar and subway
network, we believe that the number of parking spaces will be adequate. The reasons for this
are outlined as follows:

      1. Access to the existing St. Andrew TTC Subway Station and Transit Services ­ As
         noted previously, this subway station is well within reasonable walking distance from the
         proposed development. Additionally, there are two streetcar routes on King Street that
         serve the proposed site, with the Route 504 streetcar providing headways of three
         minutes or less during the peak hours. Furthermore, the Yonge-University-Spadina
         subway runs at headways of 2 to 3 minutes during the peak hours. By being in close
         proximity to and having access to the station via the PATH underground system,
         residents, tenants and visitors will be able to use high frequency, high capacity transit
         service with relative ease, without having to travel outside for extended periods of time
         during inclement weather. In addition, the site is a relatively short commute from Union
         Station, Toronto's major transit hub with access to TTC, GO Transit and VIA Rail
         services.

      2. Critical mass of services within the King-John area ­ the King-John area is already
         well served by shops, restaurants, professional offices, supermarkets plus other
         utilitarian and entertainment options. This will mitigate the necessity, especially for
         residents, to drive to other locations to meet their needs.

    3. Continuing congestion in downtown Toronto, and the high cost of parking and
       vehicle ownership ­ Downtown Toronto is perceived today as an extremely busy area
       to travel, especially in a motor vehicle. This condition has the potential to shift more
       people away from owning or travelling by car, since travel times may actually be better
       via transit or by walking or cycling. For example, a resident that works downtown and
       lives in the proposed development may only need a car on rare occasions given the
       multitude of transit options available, and may decide that the cost of car ownership is
       too high to justify for these infrequent usages.

    4. Examples of other developments with reduced standards ­ There are several
       examples of developments within Toronto that have been successful with a lower
       number of parking spaces. These includes the development at 426 University Avenue,
       where the By-law required 194 spaces but the development was approved with only 9
       spaces, with a parking ratio of 0.03 spaces per residential unit. Furthermore, other
       developments such as the Festival Tower at 326 King Street West and M5V at 375 King
       Street West were successful in selling their one-bedroom units even though these units
       were not allocated parking spaces. These sample developments are all located in highly
       urbanized areas, some near to the proposed site, and all are served by excellent transit
       services. Given that 63% of the units in the proposed development are 1-bedroom or
       smaller, it can be expected that the demand for parking spaces will be low.

    5. Provision of Carshare services­ As recommended in the Transportation Demand
       Management (TDM) initiatives in the following Section, the provision of carshare
       services would also allow for lower vehicle ownership, since infrequent drivers would no
       longer need to own a vehicle to meet their needs. Furthermore, carshare services such
       as Autoshare are located in the immediate vicinity, providing additional locations for
       residents and patrons to access this service.

    6. Provision of Bicycle parking ­ The proposed development includes the provision for
       approximately 1,824 resident and visitor bicycle parking spaces. While this does not
       meet the by-law requirements, the number of bicycle spaces is still significant and
       represents a major incentive for users and residents of the proposed development to
       cycle. For example, according to 2006 TTS data, the cycling modal split for this area was
       approximately 3%. Therefore, the expected number of cycling trips from the
       development, based on the 2006 modal split, would be less than 100 for both the a.m.
       and p.m. peak hours. The number of bicycle spaces proposed for this development
       would support a significantly higher number of cyclists than what was observed in 2006.
       As a result, we expect that the number of bicycle parking spaces will be more than
       sufficient for the development. At the same time, these spaces provide a large incentive
       for more users and residents of the proposed development to cycle rather than drive a
       private vehicle.

    As a result, we believe that the parking provided for this development is appropriate, taking
    into account all of the above considerations.

7.0      TRANSPORTATION DEMAND MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES

         Transportation Demand Management is a general term for various strategies that
         increase transportation system efficiency by managing the demand for travel. TDM
         treats mobility as a means to an end, rather than an end in itself, and emphasizes the
         movement of people and goods rather than motor vehicles. Generally speaking, TDM
         initiatives discourage single-occupant vehicle travel and encourage more efficient modes
         such as walking, cycling, ridesharing, public transit and teleworking, particularly under
         congested conditions. In the context of an already congested road network, TDM
         elements are an essential part of any progressive transportation and traffic plan for a
         proposed development.

         This section outlines various TDM elements that could be incorporated into the proposed
         development to facilitate the reduction of trips to and from the site by single-occupant
         vehicle.

         Pedestrian and Cycling Connectivity

         Although not directly connected to Toronto's cycling network, the development is in
         relatively close proximity to existing bikeway facilities. These include the suggested links
         to the cycling network on Peter Street and Bay Street, as well as the on-street bike lanes
         on Beverly Street to the north. Furthermore, pedestrian connections surround the entire
         development with sidewalks on King, John, Duncan and Pearl Streets, and as noted
         previously, there is an underground pedestrian connection to the PATH System via 225
         King Street West. The prevalence of services within walking distance, as well as the
         local road congestion encourages using alternative forms of transportation.

         Bicycle Parking Facilities

         The proposed development will include up to 1,020 bicycle parking spaces in the
         underground parking lot. The parking facilities will be well lit and provide convenient
         access to building entrances. A combination of bicycle lockers and standard "non
         wheel-bender" bicycle racks will be provided to serve long- and short-term users,
         respectively.

         Shower and Changing Facilities

         The proposed development may include shower and change facilities for those
         employees who choose to commute by active transportation methods such as cycling,
         in-line skating and walking. These facilities will make those alternative modes of
         transportation more attractive to commuters.

         Transit Services

         The excellent transit services in the area will serve to reduce the number of auto trips
         that need to be made. This has been accounted for in the study through the use of
         reduced trip rates. As transit services improve over time, dependence on motor vehicles
         is expected to decrease even further in the area, and for this development.

         Residential Condominium TDM Initiatives

         The proposed development includes several employment uses, including various retail
         and commercial uses, an art gallery and an OCAD campus. Employers with 50 or more
         full-time staff will be required to develop a TDM plan for their business, which could
         include the following:

              Employer-sponsored transit passes for residents and employees. These discounted
              monthly transit passes make this alternative mode of transportation more financially
              viable for commuters, while also encouraging regular use throughout the month.

              Promoting lower auto ownership through the provision of a carshare program within
              the condominium corporation. For those residents who only need to use motor
              vehicles on an occasional basis, a carshare program would provide an additional
              option to car ownership, and as a result reduce the need for parking spaces in the
              development.

              A "Guaranteed Ride Home" program, which supports transport mode choices other
              than single occupant vehicle ­ such as transit, carpooling, cycling or walking ­ by
              providing a guaranteed alternative transportation arrangement in the occasional
              event that person needs to get home (or to a local school, hospital, family member's
              home, etc.) outside their regular commute schedule. Programs generally reimburse
              the person for taxi fare or car rental, or involve the provision of a company vehicle or
              co-worker driver arrangement. For example, a car pooler who must stay at work
              later than usual, and thus misses their ride, is reimbursed for taxi fare home. For
              those individuals who are registered on the "Carpool Zone" website, the Smart
              Commute program reimburses commuters for taxi fares through Metrolinx.

              Teleworking policies, where feasible, to encourage employees to work from home or
              satellite offices so they can minimize their need to commute.

         Smart Commute Toronto-Central

         Assistance is available to employers in planning and implementing the employer-based
         TDM initiatives outlined above. The Smart Commute Toronto-Central organization
         represents a local TMA that will be a great asset to the proposed development in
         planning and implementing TDM initiatives. This TMA will provide a valuable TDM
         resource to business owners operating in the proposed development by:

              Providing reference materials and expert advice;

              Making staff available for presentations to management and employees;

              Supporting the development of employer-based TDM programs, including conducting
              employee commuting surveys, performing site audits, networking with local transit
              authorities and more;

              Coordinating TDM initiatives among multiple employers and organizations to find
              synergies and economies of scale; and

              Supporting staff and residents regarding the provision of information on the above-
              noted "Carpool Zone", and assistance in registering on the Smart Commute website.

         The condominium corporation in the proposed development will be encouraged to apply
         for membership with Smart Commute Toronto-Central, in order to be able to have
         access to these TDM services.

8.0      SITE CIRCULATION ASSESSMENT

Our site circulation assessment was completed using the AutoTURN 8 software package to
ensure adequate manoeuvrability through the site. The vehicle movements were tested using a
ground floor CAD base file "SK-093.2.dwg" sent on September 10, 2012.

The vehicles used for the AutoTURN analyses were a combination of Transportation
Association of Canada (TAC) vehicles and a custom garbage truck representative of a City of
Toronto front-end-loader. This custom garbage truck was developed based on the vehicle
dimensions outlined in Appendix A (page 3) of the "City of Toronto Requirements for Garbage
and Recycling Collection from New Developments and Redevelopments". Figures 8.1 to 8.24
are attached for easy reference, and the findings and recommendations are as follows:

8.1      Ground Floor Assessments

Figure 8.1 ­ City of Toronto Front-End-Loader Garbage Truck ­ East Block

As illustrated in Figure 8.1, the inbound and outbound manoeuvres at the driveway access and
into the loading pad work well given the swept paths illustrated.

Figure 8.2 ­ City of Toronto Front-end-loader Garbage Truck ­ East Block (North on Duncan)

As illustrated in Figure 8.2, the inbound and outbound manoeuvres at the driveway access and
into the loading pad work well given the swept paths illustrated.

Figures 8.3 and 8.4 ­ Light Single Unit (LSU) Delivery Truck ­ East Block

For the purposes of this analysis, a TAC LSU truck was used to represent a Type C truck, and
this vehicle manoeuvres well into and out of the loading area with no modifications required.

Figure 8.5 ­ Heavy Single Unit (HSU) Delivery Truck ­ East Block

The TAC HSU truck was tested since it is representative of a Type B truck. This vehicle is able
to manoeuvre into, out of and within the loading area for the East Block.

Delivery trucks that are larger than an HSU should be restricted from accessing the east tower
loading area. Larger delivery trucks would be required to complete deliveries curbside on Pearl
Street, but would need to obey the City's parking/standing restrictions.

Figure 8.6 ­ City of Toronto Front-End-Loader Garbage Truck ­ West Block

As illustrated in Figure 8.6, the inbound and outbound manoeuvres at the driveway access and
into the loading pad work well given the swept paths illustrated.

Figure 8.7, 8.8 and 8.9 ­ Heavy Single Unit (HSU) Delivery Truck ­ West Block

The HSU truck is able to manoeuvre into, out of and within the loading area for the three
potential Type B and G/B loading/unloading spaces as illustrated in Figure 8.7 through 8.9.

Delivery trucks that are larger than an HSU should be restricted from accessing the west tower
loading areas. Larger delivery trucks would be required to complete deliveries curbside on Pearl
Street, but would need to obey the City's parking/standing restrictions.

Figure 8.10 and 8.11 ­ Light Single Unit (LSU) Delivery Truck ­ West Block

The inbound and outbound manoeuvres at the driveway access to the loading pads work well
given the swept paths as illustrated in figures 8.10 and 8.11.

8.2      Underground Parking Garage Assessments

Figure 8.12 to Figure 8.14 ­ Passenger Vehicle (PTAC) ­ East Block

The East Block drive aisles (including ramps) must be widened to a minimum of 6.0 metres in
order to meet required standards. The current drive aisle and ramp width (highlighted in Figure
8.13) is not sufficient to accommodate two-way traffic, nor is it enough to accommodate vehicles
reversing out of their parking spaces. Furthermore, we recommend that convex mirrors be
provided at all corners to assist with visibility when making turns, and to consider rounding the
corners of the walls to assist with vehicle manoeuvring.

The parking spot on Level P2 adjacent to "P50" (highlighted in Figure 8.14) is too narrow and
should be removed. The parking space is obstructed by the wall and therefore needs to be at
least 2.9 metres in width, it is only 2.6m currently. The ramp also needs to be widened to 6m.

In addition, to allow for proper parking manoeuvering into and out of the parking spot located in
the northeast corner (see Figure 8.14), no obstacles should be placed between the parking
space line and the east wall.

Figure 8.15 to Figure 8.24 ­ Passenger Vehicle (PTAC) ­ West Block

A passenger vehicle can manoeuvre onto all of the parking levels for the West Block. However,
some minor modifications to the placement of some of the parking stalls will be required to
ensure that vehicles can reverse into or out of their spaces. To allow for proper parking
manoeuvering into and out of the parking spots on Level P1 (see Figures 8.17 through 8.20), no
obstacles should be placed between the parking space line and the northern wall. The parking
spot highlighted in Figure 8.21 should be removed to allow the vehicle to access the furthest
southwesterly spot.

9.0      CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

         This report has assessed the ability of the road network to accommodate the proposed
         development at Nos. 266 to 322 King Street West.

         The boundary road network under total future traffic conditions for the 2017 horizon is
         expected to accommodate the traffic generated by the proposed development.
              The road network is expected to be minimally impacted by the development, with
              only minor changes in delays and v/c ratios at most study area intersections.
              At the John/King intersection the LOS is expected to decreases to `D' under total
              future conditions with the southbound movements operating at capacity during the
              p.m. peak hour. It is expected that this movement will be self-regulating in the sense
              that as delays become higher, vehicles will divert to other intersections to access
              King Street.
              At the Ed Mirvish Way/Pearl Street intersection the LOS is expected to decrease to
              `E', with a delay of less than 40 seconds and no critical movements, during the p.m.
              peak hour. No improvements are recommended at this intersection.
              The number of parking spaces proposed for the development is reasonable given the
              location of the site, the types of trips being made, the aggressive TDM strategies
              recommended and other similar approved developments that are operating
              successfully in Toronto with lower parking standards.
              Various transit services are provided in the area, which will reduce the need for
              residents, tenants, visitors and patrons to use motor vehicles thereby reducing the
              impact on the road network.

         Our findings indicate that the proposed development will have a limited impact on the
         boundary road network. Additionally, significant transit services in the area as well as
         TDM measures such as the provision of a large number of bicycle spaces, will further
         reduce any effects of the development.

Level of Service Definitions
    LEVEL OF SERVICE DEFINITIONS AT SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS( 1)
Level of service for signalized intersections is defined in terms of delay, which is a measure of driver
discomfort and frustration, fuel consumption, and lost travel time. Specifically, level-of-service (LOS)
criteria are stated in terms of the average control delay per vehicle, typically for a 15-min analysis
period. The criteria are given in the table below. Delay may be measured in the field or estimated using
software such as Highway Capacity Software. Delay is a complex measure and is dependent upon a
number of variables, including quality of progression, the cycle length, the green ratio, and the v/c ratio
for the lane group in question.

    Level of                                               Features                                   Control
    Service                                                                                          Delay per
                                                                                                    vehicle (sec)
            A                   LOS A describes operations with very low delay, up to 5 sec          10
                                per vehicle. This level of service occurs when progression is
                                extremely favourable and most vehicles arrive during the green
                                phase. Most vehicles do not stop at all. Short cycle lengths
                                may also contribute to low delay.

            B                   LOS B describes operations with delay greater than 10 and up        > 10 and  20
                                to 20 sec per vehicle. This level generally occurs with good
                                progression, short cycle lengths, or both. More vehicles stop
                                than with LOS A, causing higher levels of average delay.

            C                   LOS C describes operations with delay greater than 20 and up        > 20 and  35
                                to 35 sec per vehicle. These higher delays may result from fair
                                progression, longer cycle lengths, or both. Individual cycle
                                failures may begin to appear at this level. The number of
                                vehicles stopping is significant at this level, though many still
                                pass through the intersection without stopping.

            D                   LOS D describes operations with delay greater than 35 and up        > 35 and  55
                                to 55 sec per vehicle. At level D, the influence of congestion
                                becomes more noticeable. Longer delays may result from
                                some combination of unfavourable progression, long cycle
                                lengths, of high v/c ratios. Many vehicles stop, and the
                                proportion of vehicles not stopping declines. Individual cycle
                                failures are noticeable.

             E                  LOS E describes operations with delay greater than 55 and up        > 55 and  80
                                to 80 sec per vehicle. This level is considered by many
                                agencies to be the limit of acceptable delay. These high delay
                                values generally indicate poor progression, long cycle lengths,
                                and high v/c ratios. Individual cycle failures are frequent
                                occurrences.

             F                  LOS F describes operations with delay in excess of 80 sec per       > 80
                                vehicle. This level, considered to be unacceptable to most
                                drivers, often occurs with oversaturation, that is, when arrival
                                flow rates exceed the capacity of the intersection. It may also
                                occur at high v/c ratios below 1.0 with many individual cycle
                                failures. Poor progression and long cycle lengths may also be
                                major contributing causes to such delay levels.

              LEVEL OF SERVICE DEFINITIONS AT UNSIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS( 1)

The level of service criteria for unsignalized intersections are given in the table below. As used here, total delay is
defined as the total elapsed time from when a vehicle stops at the end of the queue until the vehicle departs from the
stop line; this time includes the time required for the vehicle to travel from the last-in-queue position to the first-in-
queue position. The average total delay for any particular minor movement is a function of the service rate or
capacity of the approach and the degree of saturation.

                                                                                                        Delay (sec/veh)
             A                         Little or no traffic delay occurs. Approaches appear open,             10
                                       turning movements are easily made, and drivers have freedom
                                       of operation.

             B                         Short traffic delays occur. Many drivers begin to feel            > 10 and  15
                                       somewhat restricted in terms of freedom of operation.

             C                         Average traffic delays occur. Operations are generally stable,     > 15 and  25
                                       but drivers emerging from the minor street may experience
                                       difficulty in completing their movement.          This may
                                       occasionally impact on the stability of flow on the major
                                       street.

             D                         Long traffic delays occur. Motorists emerging from the minor       > 25 and  35
                                       street experience significant restriction and frustration.
                                       Drivers on the major street will experience congestion and
                                       delay as drivers emerging from the minor street interfere with
                                       the major through movements.
