10 St. Mary Street Mixed-Use Development



1.0      INTRODUCTION

LEA Consulting Ltd. (LEA) was retained by Lifetime St. Mary Inc. to prepare a Transportation
Impact Study for a proposed mixed-use condominium development on the property municipally
known as 10 St. Mary Street in the City of Toronto (herein referred to as the “subject site”). The
subject site is located within the area bounded by Charles Street West to the north, Yonge Street to
the east, St. Nicholas Street to the west and St. Mary Street to the south. Figure 1-1 illustrates the site
location in context of the surrounding road network.

2.0     EXISTING TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
2.1     ROAD NETWORK

The study area includes the signalized intersection of Charles Street West with Yonge Street, as well
as the unsignalized intersections of St. Mary Street with Yonge Street, St. Mary Street with St.
Nicholas Street, and St. Nicholas Street with Charles Street West. The existing lane configurations
within the study area are shown in Figure 2-1.




Figure 2-1: Existing lane Configurations

Yonge Street is a major north-south arterial road that operates within the study area with a four-lane
cross-section. The roadway intersects Charles Street at a signalized intersection. Shared turning lanes
are provided in the northbound and southbound directions at the Yonge Street/Charles Street
intersection. No speed limit is posted and is assumed to be a 50 km/hr.


                                           Project 9307                                       July 2014

10 St. Mary Street Mixed-Use Development


Charles Street is a local road which extends from Queens Park to Jarvis Street. Charles Street
operates one-way westbound between Ted Rogers Way/Jarvis Street and Balmuto Street. Charles
Street operates with a single through lane. On-street parking is permitted along the north side of the
street for a maximum of one hour between 6:00 p.m. and 8 a.m. from Monday to Saturday. No speed
limit is posted and is assumed to be a 50 km/hr.

St. Mary Street is a local road which extends from Yonge Street to a point 180 metres west of Bay
Street. St. Mary Street operates two-way west of St. Nicholas Street, and one-way in the eastbound
direction between St. Nicholas Street and Yonge Street. Public on-street parking is permitted along
the south side of the street at all times except during overnight periods from 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.,
when parking is by permit only. At its intersection with Yonge Street, the St. Mary Street width of
roadway pavement is sufficient to accommodate two turning lanes. No speed limit is posted and is
assumed to be a 50 km/hr.

St. Nicholas Street is a two-way local road which extends from Charles Street West to Irwin
Avenue. The roadway has a single through lane in each direction. On-street parking is restricted
during the daytime but is permitted from 10:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. by permit only. No speed limit is
posted and is assumed to be a 50 km/hr.


2.2     EXISTING TRANSIT NETWORK

The proposed development is well served by public transit as it is located less than 300 metres from
the Bloor-Yonge Subway Station. This subway station provides access to the two major subway
lines: the Yonge-University-Spadina line and the Bloor-Danforth line. The Yonge-University-
Spadina line extends to Downsview Station on the Spadina side and Finch Station on the Yonge side,
while providing access to most of the Downtown core. Transfers to surface routes either in the form
of bus or streetcar are also possible at many stations. Transferring onto the Bloor-Danforth and
Sheppard subway lines is also available. During the a.m. and p.m. peak, the Yonge-University-
Spadina line operates with 2-3 minute headway. Outside of peak hours trains are scheduled to arrive
every 5 minutes.

The Bloor-Danforth line extends from Kipling Station to Kennedy Station. This provides rapid transit
access to areas east and west of Downtown Toronto. The Bloor-Danforth line also provides access to
Pearson International Airport via the Pearson Express. Transferring onto surface routes in the form of
either bus or streetcar is possible at many stations. Connections may also be made onto the Yonge-
University-Spadina line as well as the Scarborough RT line. Union Station can be reached via
transfer to the Yonge-University-Spadina line. During the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours, the
Bloor-Danforth subway line operates with 2-3 minute headway. Outside of peak hours trains are
scheduled to arrive every 5 minutes.

Several bus routes also serve the surrounding area such as the 97 Yonge, 6 Bay, and the 94 Wellesley
bus routes. These routes are all within 400 metres of the subject site. A map of TTC routes can be
seen in Figure 2-2.

2.3     EXISTING CYCLING NETWORK

The subject site is conveniently accessible to cyclists. Cycling routes are present on Wellesley Street
and along Bloor Street, which are approximately 260m and 360m, respectively, from the subject site.
A map of existing routes in the vicinity of the subject site can be seen in Figure 2-3.

2.4     TRAFFIC DATA COLLECTION

Turning movement counts of the existing site accesses and intersections in the study area were
conducted by LEA on Wednesday, April 23, 2014 during peak a.m. and p.m. periods. The a.m. and
p.m. peak hours were observed to occur from 8:15 a.m. to 9:15 a.m. and from 5:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.
During the field surveys, the northbound curb lane of Yonge Street north of Charles Street was
closed due to construction activity. This lane closure affected movements along Yonge Street,
potentially reducing overall north-south traffic volumes from the typical conditions. Nonetheless, the
existing analysis in this study has been carried out based on the April 2014 traffic volumes. The
existing traffic volumes for the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours are presented in Figure 2-4.

2.5       INTERSECTION CAPACITY ANALYSIS

Intersection capacity analysis was performed for the signalized and unsignalized intersections in the
study area using the Synchro 8.0 software applying the methodology outlined in the Highway
Capacity Manual (HCM) 2000. The analysis follows the City of Toronto’s 2010 Synchro Guidelines
and 2009 Pedestrian Timing at Signalized Intersections Guidelines. Field measurements of the
intersection lane widths were applied in the analysis. The turning movement counts used for this
study can be found in Appendix B.

The official signal timing plans for the intersection of Yonge Street and Charles Street were obtained
from the City of Toronto and are included in Appendix B. The intersection functions in a fixed-time
mode, with a 60-second cycle during the a.m. peak period, and a 64-second cycle during the p.m.
peak period. This signal has the capability to operate under a SCOOT control, with cycle lengths
varying between 60-80 seconds. The intersection capacity analyses under all traffic scenarios were
conducted using the fixed-time mode in order to reflect the most conservative circumstances.
SCOOT operation would be expected to optimize signal operations and levels of service.

Table 2-1 and Table 2-2 summarize the levels of service at the relevant intersections under both
weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours of existing traffic conditions. Detailed Synchro outputs for the
existing traffic condition analysis can be found in Appendix C.

10 St. Mary Street Mixed-Use Development

Under existing traffic conditions, the intersection of Yonge Street and Charles Street operates with
good levels of service during both weekday peak hours. This may be due to the low north-south
volumes observed on account of the construction occurring on Yonge Street north of Charles Street.
The analysis of this intersection during the future background and future total scenarios will be
carried out using older counts from the City of Toronto in order to reflect more typical conditions
when construction activity on Yonge Street is finished.

Analysis of unsignalized intersections suggest that during the weekday a.m. peak hour all
unsignalized intersections in the study area operate well within capacity, with good levels of service
and short delays (see Table 2-2).

Table 2-2: Unsignalized Intersections – Existing Traffic

During the weekday p.m. peak hour, all unsignalized intersections operate with good levels of
service, with the exception of the Yonge Street and St. Mary Street intersection, which the capacity
analysis indicates, currently experiences significant problems in the eastbound direction. The analysis
suggests that high pedestrian volumes along the west leg of this intersection are causing long queues
and delays, particularly to the right-turning movement. Eastbound movements at this T-intersection


                                                   Project 9307                                             July 2014
City of Toronto - Transportation Impact Study                                                                  9
10 St. Mary Street Mixed-Use Development

are therefore largely dependent on “courtesy” gaps from pedestrians, as well as from north-south
drivers. In certain situations, eastbound-left turning vehicles may have to undertake a two-stage
manoeuvre, first crossing the southbound lanes when gaps are available, and subsequently waiting
for a gap in the northbound flows. This condition is typical of downtown areas with high pedestrian
volumes, where it is expected that drivers and pedestrians make eye-contact and negotiate priority.

3.0     FUTURE BACKGROUND TRAFFIC CONDITIONS

For the purposes of this study, a five year study horizon was selected for analysis of future traffic
conditions (year 2019). The following sub-sections outline our assumptions for the future
background traffic scenario, which represents future traffic conditions at the intersections within the
study area without the proposed development application. The future background traffic volumes
therefore reflect general corridor growth in the study area, as well as other specific developments
expected to be built in the surrounding area within the study horizon.

3.1     TRAFFIC VOLUMES ALONG YONGE STREET

As indicated in existing traffic conditions, north-south volumes at the intersection of Yonge Street
and Charles Street were observed to be lower than usual at the time of our April 2014 field survey,
due to construction activity north of Charles Street. In order to reflect typical traffic conditions at this
intersection, with 2-lane northbound operations along Yonge Street north of Charles Street, in the
future background traffic scenario, we have used the northbound and southbound through movements
from an August 2010 count obtained from the City of Toronto.


3.2     CORRIDOR TRAFFIC GROWTH

In addition to the use of higher historical north-south volumes at the Yonge Street and Charles Street
intersection, we have also applied a general traffic growth rate on the Yonge Street corridor to
account for future background traffic growth. A review of historical and current traffic data for the
intersection of Yonge Street and Charles Street suggests no clear growth pattern for the corridor.
Additional review of other recent Transportation Impact Studies conducted recently for similar
developments in the area, such the proposed development at 625 Yonge Street (LEA, September,
2012), suggested a conservative traffic growth rate of 1% per annum on north-south movements on
Yonge Street. We have therefore used this rate in order to maintain consistency with the other
reports.

Detailed diagrams illustrating the base future background traffic volumes with the August 2010 count
and corridor traffic growth can be found in Appendix D.

3.3       BACKGROUND DEVELOPMENTS

The future background developments to be included in the future background traffic scenario were
identified in consultation with City of Toronto Staff. Table 3-1 and Table 3-2 summarize the
developments included. Traffic volumes associated with each development were obtained from their
respective Transportation Impact Studies. For developments that did not have a traffic study, LEA
estimated their traffic for the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours, based on the trip generation rates
derived from the 625 Yonge Street TIS for residential developments and from the 595 Bay Street
(Atrium on Bay) Traffic Report for office-retail developments. The future background development
volumes are presented in Appendix D. A number of developments included in this study did not
assign any traffic through the study area.

3.4     INTERSECTION CAPACITY ANALYSIS

Under future background traffic conditions, the intersections within the study area generally operate
at acceptable levels of service. The capacity constraints observed at unsignalized intersections in the
existing conditions persist, particularly when considering the higher volumes expected in the future
background traffic scenario.

Table 3-3 and Table 3-4 summarize the levels of service at the signalized and unsignalized
intersections under future background traffic conditions, respectively. Detailed Synchro outputs for
future background traffic condition analysis can be found in Appendix E.

The analysis demonstrates that the signalized Yonge Street and Charles Street intersection operates at
good levels of service during both weekday peak hours. During the p.m. peak hour, however, the

northbound movements approach capacity and begin to experience slightly longer delays and longer
queues than were observed in the existing conditions. As previously indicated, SCOOT signal
operation would lengthen cycle lengths and allocate additional green time to the north-south phases
when warranted by vehicular flows across the Yonge Street corridor, thereby alleviating capacity
constraints and reducing delays.

Table 3-3: Signalized Intersections – Future Background Traffic

Analysis of the unsignalized intersections suggest that during the weekday a.m. peak hour all
unsignalized intersections in the study area operate well within capacity (see Table 3-4). The
eastbound-left movement at the intersection of Yonge Street with St. Mary Street will experience an
in delay on account of the increase in north-south vehicle volumes and the resulting reduction in gap
opportunities, but it will nonetheless operate well, with a queue of less than 4 cars.

During the weekday p.m. peak hour, however, the high north-south vehicle and pedestrian traffic
volumes on Yonge Street will significantly reduce gap opportunities for eastbound movements at St.
Mary Street, which will translate to some noticeable delays. As previously mentioned, this is typical
of downtown conditions, and it is expected that drivers will benefit from “courtesy” gaps and from
pedestrian platooning to execute their movements.

10 St. Mary Street Mixed-Use Development



4.0     TRIP GENERATION

The subject site is currently occupied by an eight-storey office building with street level retail. The
proposed redevelopment would replace the existing uses on the site. Vehicle trips associated with the
existing building will be removed from the study area under proposed conditions.

Residential trip generation rates for this proposed development area based on the rates approved for
the proposed mixed-use residential-retail development at 625 Yonge Street, given that development’s
proximity and similarity to that proposed for 10 St. Mary Street.

The proposed development does not provide on-site parking for the retail uses. The proposed new
retail would therefore be expected to draw from the existing clientele in the area, and not generate
any significant new retail trips. Furthermore, the subject site is located in very close proximity to
subway transit, in an area that is amenable to walking and cycling. As such, no retail site trip
generation has been considered in this study.

The residential trip generation rates used for the proposed development are summarized in Table 4-1.
While the most current site plan proposes 255 residential units, this study was carried out considering
260 residential units. The proposed development is therefore estimated to generate 42 (10 inbound
and 32 outbound) and 44 (29 inbound and 15 outbound) vehicle trips during the weekday a.m. and
p.m. peak hours, respectively. Since the proposed development will replace the existing uses on the
site, the existing site trips have been removed from the future site trip generation.

5.0     TRIP DISTRIBUTION & ASSIGNMENT

The trip distribution for the residential component of the proposed development was determined by
home-based trip information found in the 2011 Transportation Tomorrow Survey database in relation
to the local road network and the proposed access arrangement for the site.

The 2006 GTA Zone of Origin and 2006 GTA Zone of Destination were used to determine the
vehicular trip distribution, summarized in Table 5-1. Detailed trip distribution calculation is included
in Appendix F.

6.0     FUTURE TOTAL TRAFFIC CONDITIONS

The intersection capacity analysis during future total traffic conditions suggests that the proposed
development will have negligible impacts on the surrounding road network. While certain
operational constraints have been identified in the future background traffic scenario, these will not
be affected by the new traffic associated with the proposed development. Detailed Synchro outputs
for the future total traffic conditions are included in Appendix H.

Vehicular access to the underground parking garage and loading area is proposed to be via St.
Nicholas Street. No changes to the external road network are proposed under future total traffic
conditions. Figure 6-1 illustrates the future total traffic volumes during the weekday a.m. and p.m.
peak hours.

10 St. Mary Street Mixed-Use Development

Under future total conditions, the intersection of Yonge Street and Charles Street continues to operate
with good levels of service during the a.m. peak period. The northbound movements approach
capacity, similar to the future background traffic conditions (see Table 6-1).

During the p.m. peak hour, the capacity constraint observed on the northbound approach in the future
background scenario persists, with the movement almost at capacity and delays increasing by 6.3
seconds. This would result in the northbound-left movements in particular waiting just over 1 cycle
to execute the movement. The average queues on this movement would remain within the spacing
between Charles Street and St. Mary Street, only occasionally spilling back to St. Mary Street. As
previously stated, the SCOOT signal operation would reduce these capacity constraints by varying
cycle lengths and increasing effective green time as needed to promote progression through the
Yonge Street corridor.

Analysis of the unsignalized intersections reveals no additional constraints, beyond the problems
faced by eastbound traffic at the Yonge Street and St. Mary intersection (see Table 6-2). The
eastbound movements continue to experience a lack of northbound gap opportunities due to the high
north-south volumes.

7.0      PARKING
7.1      VEHICULAR PARKING

The proposed development will offer 49 parking spaces for residents, provided with four
underground parking levels. The underground parking is accessible via two vehicle elevators located
off St. Nicholas Street.

Based on the technical specifications of the vehicle elevators, it is estimated that each elevator could
process up to 28 vehicles per hour. This is sufficient to adequately service the 29 inbound trips
expected to be generated by the proposed development during the weekday p.m. peak hour. Based on
these considerations, we estimate that during the weekday p.m. peak hour, an average of less than
two vehicles will be queued to access the parking elevators. The operation of the elevators is
therefore not expected to cause any significant disruption to vehicle circulation on St. Nicholas
Street, which is a local street with low traffic volumes. The vehicle elevator queue analysis is
included in Appendix I.

In reviewing the proposed underground parking garage, we note that the drive aisles and parking
spaces conform to the dimensions stipulated by the City of Toronto Zoning By-Law No. 569-2013.


7.2      BICYCLE PARKING

A total of 260 resident and 56 visitor bicycle parking spaces are proposed, which is 61 (31
residential, 30 visitor) spaces more than the 229 resident and 26 visitor bicycle parking spaces
required under Zoning By-Law No. 569-2013.

Bicycle parking for residents are located on the four underground parking levels, while visitor
bicycle parking is located on the second floor mezzanine. The bicycle parking requirements are
outlined in Table 7-1.

10 St. Mary Street Mixed-Use Development

9.0     CONCLUSIONS

·     Under existing traffic conditions, all signalized and unsignalized intersections operate at
      acceptable levels of service. The eastbound movements at the intersection of Yonge Street with
      St. Mary Street, however, experience capacity constraints during the weekday p.m. peak hour
      due to heavy pedestrian volumes crossing the west leg of that intersection, and heavy north-
      south vehicular volumes on Yonge Street. Site observations suggest that the movement
      operates slightly better than indicated by the Synchro analysis due to “two-stage” gaps
      undertaken by the outbound vehicles.

·     Future background traffic conditions include background development site traffic and corridor
      traffic growth on Yonge Street. All signalized intersections are expected to operate with
      acceptable delays under future background traffic conditions. The unsignalized intersection at
      Yonge Street and St. Mary Street is expected to continue experiencing existing capacity
      constraints on eastbound movements, due to the limited gap opportunities resulting from heavy
      north-south pedestrian and vehicle volumes.

·     A total of 255 residential units and 251 m2 of retail are proposed. Analysis in this study has
      reviewed trip generation associated with 260 units. It is estimated that 260 residential units will
      generate approximately 42 and 44 two-way trips during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours,
      respectively.

·     Under future total traffic conditions, the vehicular trips generated by the proposed development
      are not expected to have a significant impact on the surrounding transportation system.

·     A total of 49 residential vehicular parking spaces are provided within the underground garage.

·     The underground parking garage drive aisles and parking spaces are consistent with the
      dimensions required by City of Toronto Zoning By-Law No. 569-2013.

·     The two proposed vehicle elevators that will provide access to the underground parking levels
      will have sufficient capacity to adequately process the peak number of hourly trips expected to
      be generated by the development, without adverse impacts on road circulation.

·     A total of 260 bicycle spaces are being provided for residents and 56 bicycle spaces for
      residential visitors for a total of 316 bicycle parking spaces meeting the by-law requirements.

·     One (1) Type “G/B” loading space will be provided for the proposed development. It will
      accommodate private garbage collection vehicles and standard delivery trucks.

Dear Mr. Nicolucci:

Re:        Terms of Reference – Traffic Impact Study for the proposed redevelopment 10 St. Mary
           Street, City of Toronto

This letter outlines the proposed Terms of Reference for the Transportation Study for the proposed
development located at 10 St. Mary Street in the City of Toronto.

The proposed development will replace an existing eight storey office building located on the southern
section of the City block bounded by Yonge Street, St. Mary Street, St. Nicholas Street and Charles
Street West. The latest site plan proposes a 42-storey residential building consisting of 295 dwelling
units and 401 square metres of retail space. Based on these plans, 68 underground parking spaces will be
provided. The Transportation Study for the redevelopment will conform to the Guidelines for the
Preparation of Transportation Impact Study. We wish to confirm the following assumptions for the
study noted above.

Study Area & Traffic Data
        • Yonge Street and St. Mary Street;
        • Yonge Street and Charles Street;
        • St. Nicholas Street and Charles Street;
        • St. Nicholas Street and St. Mary Street; and,
        • Proposed Site Access and St. Nicholas Street.
City of Toronto turning movement counts available for this intersection (and captured within the past 2
years) will be utilized for the study. LEA will also obtain additional field data as required.

Transit Services

LEA will review and summarize the existing transit services in the area on Yonge Street. Bus blockages
will be based on traffic counts or bus schedules and considered in the Synchro Analysis.

Traffic Assessment and Study Horizon Year

The study will focus on the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hour traffic operations. Synchro version 8.0
will be used to assess intersection operations during the peak hours. The analyses will be in accordance
with the City’s Synchro 7 Guidelines. A five-year horizon will be assessed in this Transportation Study.

Background Traffic

General Corridor Growth Rate - LEA will review historical traffic count data at the intersection of Yonge
Street and Charles Street Avenue to determine whether incorporating a general corridor growth rate
would be applicable to this study.
Background Development Traffic

A review of all background developments located in the nearby vicinity as defined within a 1 kilometre
radius of the subject site was conducted and identified 30 active development applications that may be
major traffic generators in the study area. Table 1 lists these background developments that we are
proposing to consider in the future background traffic forecasts.

Table 1 (Continued): List of Background Developments

It is noted that some background developments may not have site traffic that passes through the subject
intersecitons. LEA will review with City Staff to confirm if the same and/or additional background
developments shall be considered for the current traffic study. Upon confirmation, LEA will need to
meet with City Staff to review the relevant background documents.

Trip Generation, Distribution, and Assignment

As the site is an office building, existing site trips will be captured, if any,and reflected in existing as
well as future background analyses and removed for future total analyses. The trip generation for the
proposed residential development will be based on proxy site survey or ITE Trip Generation calculation
methodologies.

The general trip distribution will be based on a review of 2011 Transportation Tomorrow Survey (TTS)
data and existing traffic flows as appropriate. Trip assignment will be revised accordingly to reflect the
configuration of site access. LEA will review the current and future modal splits in the area.

Future Traffic Scenarios – future background and future total analysis over a 5-year horizon will be
conducted.

Site Access and Circulation

The Transportation Study will also recommend any road network improvements and/or signal timing
modifications required to accommodate the traffic generated by the proposed redevelopment.

Appropriate traffic signal warrant analysis and sight line review will be conducted for any proposals to
signalize existing and/or future intersection(s)/access(es).

Should you have any concerns with our assumptions, please contact me at (905) 470-0015, Ext. 240 or
Emanuel Nicolescu at Ext. 277.

Waste Management Plan and Truck Turning Paths

To whom it may concern,



In the matter of Waste and Recycling removal from the proposed development at 10 St Mary St,
collection, staging and routing plan has been formulated that will allow for the removal of waste and
recycling from the premises in accordance with city requirements to adhere to the City of Toronto’s
Development Infrastructure Policy and Standards. At your request, I have provided the plan and my
methodology.




10 St Mary St Residential Waste Plan
Assessment:
It can be difficult to predict exactly how much waste will be produced by the residents. The city has
allowances for volume based on the number of units of a building but many factors can add or subtract
that volume. Knowing this, I find it best to prepare for the most volume of comparable sized buildings.
The building with the highest volume for approximately 255 units disposes of 18 compacted yards of
waste, 30 uncompacted yards of recycling and 4 yards of organic recycling each week. We service
several 300 unit buildings that dispose of as little as 9 compacted yards of garbage, 18 uncompacted
yards of single stream recyclables and 2 yards of organic recycling per week.

As such the building should be prepared to have:

        4 bins for regular waste to be emptied two to threes times per week.

                These are standard 3 yard3 containers measuring 84” wide, 60” tall and 42” deep

        4 bins for recyclables to be picked up two to three times per week

                Also in 3 yard3 containers (84”x60”x42”)

         2 bins for organic recyclables to be picked up once a week. However, to date the most I have
seen is 3 bins for a similar size building, Making sure there is room to grow here will be important in the
future as the population gets used to separating organics out of their regular waste.

                These will be 2 yard3 containers (84”x48”x36”)

Under the current drawings, there has been room made for 12 bins (9 in the storage room and 3 in the
chute room). This should suffice.

                                                                                   Toronto ON M4G 1Y2
                                                                                           647-339-2786


Proposed Scheduling:
The building’s volume will be undetermined until the residents’ usage hits its natural equilibrium but
WM has garbage services available 6 days per week and recycling available 5 days per week.

Time necessary to do pickup
Once the bins are staged, a truck arrives at the site to begin emptying the containers. The process of
emptying a container involves these steps:

The driver will back into the driveway from St Nicholas St into the loading area where the Rear Load
bins would be located. The bins will be rolled to and attached to the truck’s lifting cable by the driver
and his helper( both provided by the Waste company), The truck will then tip the bins into the charge
chamber , dumping the payload then put it back down, the driver and his helper will detach the bin and
repeat the process for as many bins are required.

To empty a 2-3 yd3 Rear Load container it would take approximately 6 minutes to arrive onsite, empty
the containers, turnaround and leave. It can take anywhere from 30 to 75 seconds as there can be
variances in the way the driver has to reposition the bins and from time to time the driver will have
activate the compaction mechanism within the truck to make room for more waste material.

Should you desire any extra clarification on this plan or future documentation, please do not hesitate to
call me at 647-339-2786.The typical timeframe for pickup of multi residential in this neighbourhood is
between 7am and 9am but arrangements can be made with the hauling company to come at different
times to suit the building better. I strongly suggest at least one weekend date to avoid commuter traffic.

Should you desire any extra clarification on this plan or future documentation, please do not hesitate to
call me at 647-339-2786.

Sincerely,



Jon Doyle
