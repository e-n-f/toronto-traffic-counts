Attn: Mr. Alexander Henry

Dear Sir:

Re:      Proposed Residential Redevelopment
         Transportation Impact and Parking Study
         40 Moccasin Trail and 50-60 Green Belt Drive, City of Toronto
         Our Project No. 12253

We are pleased to present the enclosed Transportation Impact and Parking Study assessing the traffic
impacts and parking needs of the proposed redevelopment of the existing residential lands at 40
Moccasin Trail and 50-60 Green Belt Drive in the City of Toronto. The proposed redevelopment for the
East Site (known municipally as 50-60 Green Belt Drive) consists of 240 condominium units. The West
Site (known municipally as 40 Moccasin Trail) will comprise of a 4-storey building with 61 rental apartment
units (West Rental Site), and a 4-storey building with 23 condominium units (West Condo Site).

This study concludes that with the implementation of an already funded and planned westbound right turn
lane at the Don Mills Road / Green Belt Drive intersection along with recommended signal timing
modifications, the proposed redevelopment of the subject lands can be accommodated by the abutting
street system.

The East Site is proposed to provide 329 parking spaces, which exceeds the City's draft by-law
requirement of 276 spaces by 53 spaces. The West Condo Site provides 23 parking spaces for residents,
which satisfies the City's draft by-law requirement, while the draft by-law-required 5 visitor parking spaces
will be provided for in the East Site's underground parking supply (across Nob Lane). Based on our proxy
parking surveys of nearby rental apartment sites, the proposed West Rental Site's parking supply of 76
spaces will be sufficient to accommodate its predicted tenant and visitor parking demands.

We trust the enclosed is sufficient for your needs, but please do not hesitate to contact the undersigned
should you require any additional assistance.

Sincerely,

The Sernas Group Inc. (A GHD Company)

1.   Introduction
     1.1         Retainer and Objective

     GHD was retained by H-M Apartment Moccasin Inc.to conduct a Transportation Impact and Parking
     Study to determine the traffic-related impacts and parking requirements of the proposed
     redevelopment of the existing residential lands at 50-60 Green Belt Drive and 40 Moccasin Trail in
     the City of Toronto. The `subject sites' include east and west redevelopment parcels ­ an East Site
     and a West Site separated by Nob Lane. The East Site is situated east of Nob Lane and north of
     Green Belt Drive, and the West Site is situated west of Nob Lane and north of Green Belt Drive.
     The subject site locations are shown in Figure 1.

     1.2         Study Background

     The proposed redevelopment for the East Site consists of 240 condominium units. Access to the
     redevelopment is proposed via two full-moves accesses, one to Green Belt Drive and one to Nob
     Lane. Figure 2 illustrates the proposed site access scheme and building footprint for the East Site.

     The proposed redevelopment for the West Site will be comprised of two buildings: a 4-storey
     building with 61 rental apartment units (West Rental Site), and a 4-storey building with 23
     condominium units (West Condo Site). Access to the West Site redevelopment is proposed via a
     shared full-moves access connecting to Green Belt Drive. In addition, there is a one-way service
     road proposed at the westerly boundary of the subject site with connections to Moccasin Trail (in
     and out moves permitted) and Green Belt Drive (outbound only). Note that the access to Moccasin
     Trail is full moves in order to provide in/out access to two at-grade visitor parking spaces. The
     internal service road continues southerly from that point in a one-way southbound-only direction
     connecting to Green Belt Drive. Figure 3 illustrates the West Site's building footprints and
     proposed site access schemes.

     This study establishes the baseline (2012) traffic volumes and operating conditions for the critical
     weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hour periods, derives and assesses the background non-site related
     (2020) traffic growth and impacts on the road network in the study area, estimates and assigns new
     site related traffic volumes onto the road network, and documents the expected site-related impacts
     from the proposed developments.

     GHD has consulted with City of Toronto staff to confirm the assumptions of this study.
     Subsequently, we have reviewed the following reports to aid in this report's preparation:

2.          Site Characteristics
            2.1         Site Environs

            The subject site is generally located south of Moccasin Trail, north of Green Belt Drive, east and
            west of Nob Lane in the City of Toronto (see Figure 1).

            The parcel identified as the East Site is currently occupied by two 3-storey apartment buildings,
            while the parcel labeled as the West Site is occupied by a 3-storey apartment building. Only the
            building on the west site is partially inhabited.

            The subject site's distance to Don Mills Road is approximately 520 metres, which provides access
            to the arterial roadway network and exposes existing and future residents to frequent transit
            service. Details of the transit service are found in Section 3.2 of this report. Future high-order
            transit plans are also in place for Don Mills Road and Eglinton Avenue, further enhancing the
            opportunity for increased transit usage for future residents of the neighbourhood.

            Green Belt Drive terminates at the easterly boundary of the easterly development site, while
            Moccasin Trail proceeds northerly and intersects The Donway East. Nob Lane connects Green Belt
            Drive with Mocassin Trail and bisects the two development sites,

            To the north of the sites is an established residential neighbourhood with single-family detached
            homes, with a connection to The Donway East. To the south of the sites there are several mid and
            high-rise residential buildings and more are under construction and/or planned for occupancy in the
            near future. Also surrounding the site to the south and north are single-family homes and
            townhouses. To the west of the site along Green Belt Drive are office/commercial uses and at the
            Don Mills Road / Green Belt Drive intersection there is an existing retail development (to the
            southwest) as well as more detached residential dwellings west of Don Mills Road.

            2.2         Study Area

            The study area includes the following intersections (as confirmed acceptable by City of Toronto
            staff):

                        Don Mills Road at Green Belt Drive / Barber Greene Road;
                        Green Belt Drive at Nob Lane / Humphrey Gate;
                        Nob Lane at Moccasin Trail;
                        The Donway East at Moccasin Trail;
                        All future primary site accesses.

            See Figure 4.

3.   Existing Conditions
     3.1      Existing Road Network

     The road network selected for in-depth investigation is shown in Figure 4. The following describes
     the existing and planned road infrastructure in this study area.

              Don Mills Road

           Don Mills Road is a major north-south arterial road under the jurisdiction of the City of
           Toronto, with a speed limit of 60 km/h in the study area. It currently has a 6-lane urban cross
           section with 2 high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes (one in each direction as the `curb' lane)
           and sidewalks on both sides. These HOV lanes are enforced during weekday peak hours
           (Monday to Friday from 07:00 to 10:00 and from 15:00 to 19:00) and are reserved for bikes,
           motorcycles, buses, taxis and private vehicles occupied by 3 or more persons. The Don Mills
           Road intersection at Green Belt Drive / Barber Greene Road is currently signalized with
           exclusive left turning lanes on all approaches.

           Within the horizon of this study, according to the City's "10 Year Roads Construction
           Program" there is road resurfacing planned for Don Mills Road in the study area. Further, as
           part of previous development approvals in the area, the City (Transportation Services) has
           secured funds to construct an exclusive westbound right-turn lane at the intersection of Don
           Mills / Green Belt. Based on our monitoring of current traffic flows and imminent demands,
           the City should consider constructing this improvement now.

              Green Belt Drive

           Green Belt Drive (known as Barber Greene Road to the west of Don Mills Road) is an east-
           west collector road under the jurisdiction of the City of Toronto. Barber Greene Road to the
           west of Don Mills Road has a 2-lane urban cross-section with sidewalks on both sides.
           Green Belt Drive to the east of Don Mills Road has a 4-lane urban cross-section from Don
           Mills Road to The Heights Drive (approximately 160 metres east of Don Mills Road) with
           sidewalks on both sides. It transitions into a 2-lane urban cross-section from The Heights
           Drive to Nob Lane with a sidewalk on the south side.

           The Green Belt Drive intersection at Nob Lane / Humphrey Gate is currently unsignalized
           with all-way stop control. There are no exclusive turning lanes on any approaches. There are
           time of day turn restrictions prohibiting eastbound left turns and westbound right turns at the
           intersection of Green Belt Drive and Nob Lane / Humphrey Gate (Monday to Friday from 16:
           00 to 18:00) - the intent to mitigate infiltration into the `Mocassin Trail' neighbourhood during
           peak periods.

           There are no improvements planned for Green Belt Drive or Barber Greene Road in the study
           area according to the City's "10 Year Roads Construction Program."

              The Donway East

           The Donway East is an east-west minor arterial `circular' roadway under the jurisdiction of the
           City of Toronto, with a speed limit of 40 km/h in the study area. The Donway East (east of
           Don Mills Road) has a 2-lane urban cross section with sidewalks on both sides. It comprises
           part of a `ring-road' around the intersection of Don Mills Road and Lawrence Avenue and
           serves many land uses including major residential, retail, and institutional uses.

           The Donway East intersection at Moccasin Trail is currently unsignalized with a stop control
           on Moccasin Trail. There are time of day turn restrictions prohibiting eastbound right turns

               Trail' neighbourhood during peak periods.

                   Moccasin Trail

              Moccasin Trail generally travels in a north-south direction and is a local road with a posted
              speed limit of 40 km/h. It has a 2-lane urban cross section with no sidewalks on either side.
              Traffic calming measures (speed humps, plus the aforementioned turning restrictions) have
              been installed along Moccasin Trail. The Moccasin Trail Intersection at Nob Lane is currently
              unsignalized with all-way stop control.

                   Nob Lane / Humphrey Gate

               Nob Lane is a north-south local road running north from Green Belt Drive with a posted
               speed limit of 40 km/h. It has a two-lane urban cross-section with no sidewalks on either
               side. Humphrey Gate is a north-south local road (running south from Green Belt Drive). It
               has a two-lane urban cross-section with a sidewalk on the west side.

               There are time of day turn restrictions prohibiting eastbound left turns and westbound right
               turns at the Green Belt Drive intersection at Nob Lane / Humphrey Gate (Monday to Friday
               from 16: 00 to 18:00).

       Figure 4 shows existing lane configurations and traffic controls of intersections within the study
       area.

       3.2         Transit Services

       The Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) currently provides the following bus service in the area:
       Route 25 Don Mills, Route 162 Lawrence - Donway, and Route 403 South Don Mills.

       The 25 Don Mills bus route operates between Pape Station on the Bloor-Danforth Subway, Don
       Mills Station on the Sheppard Subway, the area of Don Mills Road and Steeles Avenue East, and
       the area of Leslie Street and 16th Avenue in the Town of Richmond Hill, generally in a north-south
       direction. In the study area, it has bus stops at Green Belt Drive / Barber Greene Road. The TTC
       Route 25 provides weekday services from 4:32 a.m. to 4:15 a.m. with 3-minute headways in the
       weekday peak periods, and also provides weekend service.

       The 162 Lawrence-Donway bus route operates between Lawrence Station on the Yonge-
       University-Spadina Subway and the area of Don Mills Road and Lawrence Avenue East, generally
       in an east-west direction. The 162 Lawrence-Donway bus route (westbound) has bus stops at
       Barber Greene Road in the study area. The TTC Route 162 (westbound) provides weekday
       services from 6:29 a.m. to 12:59 a.m. with 30-minute headways during the all service periods, and
       also provides weekend service.

       The 403 South Don Mills Community Bus route provides accessible service in the South Don Mills
       area. It operates between Don Mills Shopping Centre, Flemingdon Park Shopping Centre and East
       York Town Centre, generally in a north-south direction. It has bus stops at Green Belt Drive / Barber
       Greene Road in the study area. The TTC Route 403 provides weekday services from 9:50 a.m. to
       17:09 p.m. with 60-minute headways in the service periods. The TTC Route 403 does not provide
       weekend service in the study area.


       3.3         Existing Traffic Data

       In order to assess the traffic volumes in the study area during the busiest travel periods, the City's
       recent (March 17, 2011) weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hour traffic counts for the Don Mills Road
       intersection at Green Belt Drive / Barber Greene Road were obtained. GHD also conducted p.m.
       peak hour turning movement counts (TMCs) on January 18, 2013 using the Miovision data
       collection system at the Don Mills Road intersection at Green Belt Drive / Barber Greene Road.
       Comparing these two TMC data, the peak direction volumes were revealed to be consistent, but the
       City's 2011 volumes of some critical movements were higher than our 2013 counts. Consequently,
       we have elected to utilize the City's counts as a conservative (high) baseline condition for the Don
       Mills Road intersection at Green Belt Drive / Barber Greene Road, even though more recent
       observations suggest lower traffic flows.

       We also conducted turning movement counts (weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours) on July 25, 2012
       using the Miovision data collection system at the following study intersections:

                   Green Belt Drive at Nob Lane / Humphrey Gate;
                   Nob Lane at Moccasin Trail.

       Automatic traffic recorder (ATR) count data (July 1994, November 2001 and April 2005) were
       obtained from the City of Toronto for Don Mills Drive in the study area.

       All the traffic data either collected from the City or by GHD in the field are contained in Appendix A.

       GHD also undertook site visits and observations to document existing traffic conditions and lane
       configurations in the study area. Figure 5 shows the resulting composite Baseline (2012) Traffic
       Volumes for weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours at the study area intersections.

As mentioned, there are time of day turn restrictions prohibiting eastbound left turns and westbound
right turns at the Green Belt Drive intersection at Nob Lane / Humphrey Gate (Monday to Friday
from 16:00 to 18:00), and eastbound right turns and westbound left turns at the intersection of The
Donway East and Moccasin Trail (Monday to Friday from 7:00 to 9:00). However, based on our
traffic counts for the Green Belt Drive intersection at Nob Lane / Humphrey Gate, there were 35
eastbound left turns and 14 westbound right turns observed (16% of the intersection volume) during
the restricted weekday p.m. peak hour period. Furthermore, at the intersection of The Donway East
and Moccasin Trail, there were 9 eastbound right turns and 19 westbound left turns observed (5%
of the intersection volume) during the restricted weekday a.m. peak hour period, suggesting a
moderate level of non-compliance to the restrictions. Notwithstanding the apparent infiltration into
the neighbourhood, the existing peak direction volumes on Nob Lane / Moccasin Trail are only
approximately 130 vehicles per hour in a single lane. This volume is well within the typical local
roadway capacity, and did not create any obvious operational issues during our field work.

3.4      Baseline (2012) Traffic Conditions

The baseline traffic volumes were subjected to intersection capacity analyses as per the
methodologies prescribed in the Highway Capacity Manual using Synchro 8 analysis software. The
existing signal timings for the Don Mills Road intersection at Green Belt Drive / Barber Greene Road
were obtained from the City of Toronto (provided in Appendix A).

As mentioned, Don Mills Road has a 6-lane urban cross section with two HOV lanes enforced
during weekday peak periods. It should be noted that there is no `HOV analysis' option in the
modeling software. Therefore, to emulate HOV lane operation / usage in the Synchro analysis, we
coded the three north/south through lanes as just two through lanes, plus exclusive right turn lanes
at the study intersection. The through volume in the two lanes was then reduced by 10% for the
a.m. peak hour to reflect the traffic volume otherwise traveling in the HOV lane (and therefore, not
represented in the two-lane flow). Based on our recently performed MioVision traffic counts, up to
17% of the northbound through traffic utilized the HOV lane during the p.m. peak hour. Therefore,
for the p.m. peak hour the northbound through volume in the two lanes was reduced by 15% (17%
rounded down), while the southbound through volume reduction in the two lanes was maintained at
10% to reflect the traffic volume traveling in the HOV lane. The right turning volumes were
restricted from turning on red to model the potential of through volumes in the HOV delaying these
right turning vehicles. We are of the opinion this is a very conservative approach to modeling the
HOV effects and is consistent with discussions held with City staff to address HOV effects

It is noteworthy that the default lost time adjustment factor in Synchro is conservative compared to
the Canadian Capacity Guide (CCG) methods (an alternative to the adopted Highway Capacity
Manual method), since it underestimates effective green time and overestimates start-up loss time.
It is expected that for an intersection with high traffic demand, the drivers are generally more
aggressive. In order to reflect this condition, the lost time adjustment is set to -1 second as
suggested by City's Synchro Software Guidelines.

For analysis purpose, `critical' intersection movements are defined as traffic movements where:

          Volume to capacity (V/C) ratio of through movement or shared through/turning movement
          exceeds 0.85; or
          Volume to capacity (V/C) ratio of an exclusive turning movement exceeds 1.0.

Table 1 summarizes the results of the intersection capacity analysis, while Appendix B contains
the baseline (2012) intersection capacity analysis summaries.

      Don Mills Road at Green Belt Drive / Barber Greene Road

      Under 2012 baseline conditions, this signalized intersection is operating at LOS `C' and `D'
      during the weekday a.m. peak hour and p.m. peak hour with overall delays of 34 and 48
      seconds respectively. The overall v/c ratio during the weekday a.m. peak hour and p.m. peak
      hour are 0.89 and 1.10 respectively (the latter representing at-capacity conditions).

      During the weekday a.m. peak hour, the southbound through movement is identified as a
      critical movement (v/c ratio of 1.00, effectively at-capacity); the southbound through vehicle
      queues occasionally reach 310 metres.

      During the weekday p.m. peak hour, the northbound through, eastbound and westbound left
      turn movements are identified as critical movements (v/c ratios of 0.94, 1.61 and 1.04). The
      northbound through vehicle queues occasionally reach 270 metres, likewise, the eastbound

              left turn vehicle queues occasionally reach 100 metres, exceed the existing left turn storage
              length (approximately 65 metres).

              Green Belt Drive at Nob Lane / Humphrey Gate

              All approaches at this unsignalized all-way stop controlled intersection are operating with
              good operational characteristics and substantial reserve capacity during both the weekday
              a.m. peak hour and p.m. peak hours.

              Nob Lane / Moccasin Trail

              All approaches at this unsignalized all-way stop controlled intersection are operating with
              good operational characteristics and substantial reserve capacity during both the weekday
              a.m. peak hour and p.m. peak hours.

              The Donway East / Moccasin Trail

              The minor (northbound) approach at this unsignalized intersection is operating at LOS `B' and
              `C' during the weekday a.m. peak hour and p.m. peak hour with delays of 11 and 23 seconds.
              The v/c ratio during the weekday a.m. peak hour and p.m. peak hour are 0.22 and 0.37,
              respectively, indicating significant reserve capacity.

4.          Background (2020) Traffic Conditions
            4.1         Study Horizon Year

            Based on consultations with the applicant, potential completion of the development is anticipated to
            be in 2015. Thus, future traffic conditions were predicted for a five-year planning horizon of 2020.

            4.2         Planned Study Area Road Network Improvements

            As part of prior development agreements in the area, the City (Transportation Services) secured
            funds for a westbound right-turn lane at the intersection of Don Mills / Green Belt. It is
            recommended that the City construct this improvement based on the existing traffic demands.
            There is no other road improvements programmed in the vicinity of the site within the time horizon
            of this study.

            It is noted that the implementation of the proposed Don Mills LRT or Eglinton Crosstown LRT are
            both beyond the time horizon (2020) contemplated in this report. Therefore, their impacts are
            neither modeled in the future traffic flows, nor examined in the analyses presented herein.


            4.3         Future Traffic/Corridor Growth

            Based on review of the available Automatic Traffic Recorder (ATR) data for Don Mills Road (July
            1994, November 2001 and April 2005) and the most recent weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hour traffic
            counts for the Don Mills Road intersection at Green Belt Drive / Barber Greene Road, there is
            marginal growth along Don Mills Road.

            The Don Valley Corridor Transportation Master Plan Study (conducted by the City of Toronto, dated
            February 2005) suggests that there has been no real growth in the Don Valley Corridor (which
            includes Don Mills Road) in the a.m. peak hour (southbound) traffic since 1981 due to capacity
            constraints. Accordingly no background traffic growth has been considered in this study. This is
            consistent with previous City-approved studies completed in this area by this consultant, recently
            approved by the OMB.


            4.4         Proposed Nearby Developments

            Although no growth in background traffic has been considered, traffic generated by other nearby
            developments within influence of the subject sites was introduced. Based on consultation with City
            staff and our review of the reports submitted for nearby development applications, the future non-
            development background traffic contributors consist of:

                        39 Green Belt Drive consisting of 350 condominium residential units;

                        120 Dallimore Circle consisting of 225 condominium residential units;
                                                                                               2
                        888-900 Don Mills Road - Building C consisting of 42,500 ft of specialty food market use;

                        1185 Eglinton Avenue consisting of 728 residential units;

         75 Wynford Drive - The Ismaili Centre and Agakham Museum (Phases 1 and 2)
         consisting of 2786 m2 place of worship, 5,556 m2 of community centre; and 10,540 m 2 of
         Museum;

         Don Mills Centre (Phase Two, including 75 and 85 The Donway West) Development
         consisting of 97,598 m2 of retail and office uses plus 1400 residential units.


Trip generations for 39 Green Belt Drive, 120 Dallimore Circle, and 888-900 Don Mills Road were
estimated using data provided in the 39 Green Belt Drive Traffic Impact Study conducted by this
consultant. This study was approved by the OMB.

Trip generations and distributions for 1185 Eglinton Avenue residential development were derived
from 1185 Eglinton Avenue Traffic Impact Study Update (prepared by LEA in August 2012).

Trip generations and distributions for 75 Wynford Drive development were derived from The Ismaili
Centre and Agakham Museum Traffic and Parking Review (prepared by BA Group in August 2006).

Trip generations and distributions for other nearby developments (including 75 and 85 The Donway
West residential developments) were derived from the Don Mills Centre ­ Phase Two
Transportation Impact Study (prepared by LEA in September 2008).

The assignments of vehicle trips generated by all nearby developments are illustrated in Appendix
C. This assignment is based on our review of the above-noted traffic reports whilst visiting the City
of Toronto offices ­ unfortunately, the reports were only made available for viewing and not
photocopying therefore, we were not able to append any actual figures or documentation.


4.5      Background (2020) Traffic Volumes


The 2012 baseline traffic plus trips generated by the above mentioned nearby developments were
combined to produce the 2020 background weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hour traffic volumes. The
background (2020) traffic volumes are presented in Figure 6.

4.6      Background (2020) Operating Conditions

4.6.1    Without Mitigation ­ Existing Lane Configurations and Signal Timing

Background (2020) scenario was then subjected to intersection capacity analysis based on the
same methodologies utilized for baseline (2012) conditions using Synchro 8 analysis software.


As mentioned in Section 3.4, lane configuration and volume adjustments were made to model the
HOV lanes during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours. The right turning volumes were restricted
from turning on red to model the potential of through volumes in the HOV stopped during the red.
The lost time adjustment is set to -1 second and peak hour factor as indicated in City's Synchro
Software Guidelines. It is noteworthy that for future traffic conditions Peak Hour Factor (PHF) is
adjusted to 1.0 based the City's Synchro Software Guidelines and our extensive experience with
other projects and analyses in the City of Toronto.

Table 2 summarizes the background (2020) traffic operations for the study area intersections.
Background (2020) intersection capacity analysis report is attached in Appendix D.

      Don Mills Road at Green Belt Drive / Barber Greene Road

      Under 2020 background conditions, this signalized intersection is expected to operate at LOS
      `C' and `F' during the weekday a.m. peak hour and p.m. peak hour with overall delays of 32
      and 82 seconds. The overall v/c ratio during the weekday a.m. peak hour and p.m. peak hour
      are 0.88 and 1.36 respectively.

      During the weekday a.m. peak hour, the southbound through movement is identified as a
      critical movement (v/c ratio of 0.97); the southbound through vehicle queues occasionally
      reach 285 metres.

      During the weekday p.m. peak hour, the northbound through and eastbound left turn
      movements are identified as critical movements (v/c ratios of 0.92 and 2.73), likewise, the
      eastbound left turn vehicle queues occasionally reach 165 metres, exceed the existing left
      turn storage length (approximately 65 metres).

      With projected background developments 100% complete, the intersection of Don Mills Road
      at Green Belt Drive will operate at its design capacity. The previously mentioned planned
      westbound right turn lane along with the signal timing modifications / optimization contained in
      our analysis should be implemented to accommodate the future 2020 background traffic
      demand.

      Green Belt Drive at Nob Lane / Humphrey Gate

      All approaches at this unsignalized all-way stop controlled intersection are expected to
      operate with good operational characteristics and substantial reserve capacity during both the
      weekday a.m. peak hour and p.m. peak hours.

      Nob Lane / Moccasin Trail

      All approaches at this unsignalized all-way stop controlled intersection are expected to
      operate with good operational characteristics and substantial reserve capacity during both the
      weekday a.m. peak hour and p.m. peak hours.

              The Donway East / Moccasin Trail

              Minor (northbound) approach at this unsignalized intersection is expected to operate at LOS
              `C' and `E' during the weekday a.m. peak hour and p.m. peak hour with delays of 18 and 40
              seconds. The v/c ratio during the weekday a.m. peak hour and p.m. peak hour are 0.54 and
              0.64, respectively, indicating that there is reserve capacity.


       4.6.2       With Mitigation ­ Planned Westbound Right Turn Lane and Optimized
                   Signal Phasing at Don Mills Road and Green Belt Drive

       Table 3 summarizes the results of the signalized intersection capacity analyses after introducing a
       westbound right turn lane and optimizing the signal timings at the intersection of Don Mills Road and
       Green Belt Drive / Barber Greene Road during a.m. and p.m. peak hours, while Appendix D
       contains detailed capacity analysis reports.

       With the implementation of a planned westbound right turn lane and the signal timing modifications,
       the Don Mills Road / Green Belt Drive intersection is expected to operate at LOS `C' during both the
       weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hours with overall delays of 29 and 35 seconds. The overall v/c ratio
       during the weekday a.m. peak hour and p.m. peak hour are 0.91 and 0.86 respectively.

       During the weekday a.m. peak hour, the southbound through movement is identified as a critical
       movement (v/c ratio of 0.93) due to the capacity constraints; the southbound through vehicle queues
       occasionally reach 270 metres.

       During the weekday p.m. peak hour, the northbound through movement is identified as a critical
       movement (v/c ratio of 0.96) due to the capacity constraints; the northbound through vehicle queues
       occasionally reach 265 metres. The eastbound left turn vehicle queues occasionally reach 110
       metres, exceeding the existing left turn storage length (approximately 65 metres). There may be
       need to extend this facility in the future to accommodate the queues, and the City should monitor
       the situation to react to this need should it present itself. This should be carefully considered and
       balanced in deference to the benefiting influence of future transit enhancements planned for just
       beyond the horizon year of this study.

       It is noteworthy to consider that as congestion builds in the future, it is reasonable to expect
       continued shift to other modes of travel (including transit, but also increased HOV lane usage). In
       this regard, and since we have maintained the existing HOV and transit mode share, the analysis
       approach is conservative and could be overstating the future impacts of background growth.

       In any event, given implementation of the signal timing adjustments and planned right turn lane,
       acceptable overall operations are achievable under this future pre-development scenario.

5.          Site Generated Traffic
            5.1         Site Trip Generation

            Based on the pre-consultation with the City staff, trip generations for the East Condo Site and West
            Condo Site redevelopments were estimated using trip generation survey rates provided in the 39
            Green Belt Drive Traffic Impact Study.

            The trips generated by the West Rental Site component were estimated based on the trip rates for
            the Mid-Rise Apartment (LUC #223) contained in Trip Generation, Edition 8, published by the
            Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE). This approach was adopted to consider the different
            trip-making dynamic of rental apartments versus residential condominiums.

            Based on the above assumptions, it is estimated that the subject sites will generate a total of 32
            inbound and 133 outbound automobile trips during a.m. peak hours, and 85 inbound and 44
            outbound automobile trips during p.m. peak hours. The weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hour trip rates
            and resultant automobile trips for the site redevelopments are summarized in Table 4.

            Trips generated by the proposed redevelopments were distributed to the roadway system using the
            existing traffic patterns provided in the 39 Green Belt Drive Traffic Impact Study ­ Addendum (see
            Table 5).

Due to concerns regarding traffic infiltration on Moccasin Trail, trips generated by the proposed
redevelopments were not assigned through the Nob Lane / Moccasin Trail intersection. To be
conservative, all trips access the arterial road network (i.e., Don Mills Road) via Green Belt Drive.

The residential weekday a.m. and p.m. peak hour directional trip distributions are summarized in
Table 6.

6.   Total (2020) Traffic Conditions
     6.1      Total (2020) Traffic Operations

     This section presents the site-traffic impact analysis and summarizes the operations of the future
     street network after introduction of estimated subject site generated traffic.

     In order to the traffic impacts due to the introduction of site related trips, the background (2020)
     traffic flows were combined with the estimated site trips to get the total (2020) weekday a.m. and
     p.m. traffic as illustrated in Figure 8.

     The future 2020 total traffic scenario comprises future 2020 background traffic and site traffic from
     the proposed developments with implementation of the recommended improvements (a westbound
     right turn lane and signal phasing improvements at Don Mills Road / Green Belt Drive)
     contemplated under the `with mitigation' future 2020 background scenario. The future (2020) lane
     configurations are shown in Figure 9. Traffic signal timings were then further refined using Synchro
     8 software after subject site trips were introduced.

     Table 7 summarizes total (2020) traffic operations for study area intersections. Detailed intersection
     capacity analysis reports can be found in Appendix E.

           Don Mills Road at Green Belt Drive / Barber Greene Road

           Under 2020 Total conditions, this signalized intersection is expected to operate at LOS `D'
           during both the weekday a.m. peak hour and p.m. peak hour with overall delays of 38 and 37
           seconds respectively. The overall v/c ratio during the weekday a.m. peak hour and p.m. peak
           hour are 0.96 and 0.93 respectively.

           During the weekday a.m. peak hour, the southbound through movement is identified as a
           critical movement (v/c ratio of 0.99) due to the capacity constraints. The southbound through
           vehicle queues will increase from 270 metres (2020 background conditions) to 285 metres
           (only a 15 metre-increase, or about two car lengths).

           During the weekday p.m. peak hour, the northbound through movement is identified as a
           critical movement (v/c ratio of 0.95) due to the prevailing capacity constraints; the northbound
           through vehicle queues occasionally reach 265 metres (same as 2020 background
           conditions). The eastbound left turn vehicle queues occasionally reach 110 metres (same as
           2020 background conditions), exceeding the existing left turn storage length (approximately
           65 metres). This is virtually unchanged compared to the pre-development condition and the
           recommendations under that background scenario (see Section 4.6, last two paragraphs) still
           apply.

           Comparing this result with 2020 background traffic condition (see Table 4), it has an
           increment (0.05 and 0.07) in overall v/c ratios for the a.m. and p.m. respectively. Critical
           movements identified during the a.m. and p.m. peak hour indicate minor increases (less than
           0.06) in v/c ratios. Overall, trips generated by subject site have marginal impacts on the
           operation of the intersection.

           Green Belt Drive at Nob Lane / Humphrey Gate

           All approaches at this unsignalized all-way stop controlled intersection are expected to
           continue to operate with good operational characteristics and substantial reserve capacity
           during both the weekday a.m. peak hour and p.m. peak hours.

                      GHD | Report for H-M Apartment Moccasin Inc. ­ Transportation Impact and Parking Study | 12253 | 25
              Green Belt Drive / Access 1 (East Site)

              Minor (southbound) approach at this unsignalized intersection is expected to operate with
              excellent operational characteristics and substantial reserve capacity during both the weekday
              a.m. peak hour and p.m. peak hours.

              Nob Lane / Access 2 (East Site)

              Minor (westbound) approach at this unsignalized intersection is expected to operate with
              excellent operational characteristics and substantial reserve capacity during both the weekday
              a.m. peak hour and p.m. peak hours.

              Green Belt Drive / Access 3 (West Condo Site)

              Minor (southbound) approach at this unsignalized intersection is expected to operate with
              excellent operational characteristics and substantial reserve capacity during both the weekday
              a.m. peak hour and p.m. peak hours.

       As is evident from a review of the above, with the implementation of a planned westbound right turn
       lane and the signal timing modifications at the Don Mills Road / Green Belt Drive intersection, the
       proposed redevelopments can be accommodated by the abutting street system. No adjacent road
       network improvements are triggered by the proposed redevelopments.

       6.2         Travel Demand Management

       Travel Demand Management (TDM) is the term used to describe initiatives, policies and
       recommendations to reduce the public's dependence on the car and use alternate modes of
       transportation (transit, carpooling, walking, cycling, and active transportation) which will contribute
       to the reduction of overall congestion and parking requirements. The location of the proposed
       development is well suited for travel demand management initiatives. TDM measures can include
       but is not limited to the following:

                   reliable transit,
                   live ­ work communities,
                   employer initiatives through flexible working hours, compressed work weeks, and
                   telecommuting,
                   employer incentives to other modes of transportation
                   bicycle storage facilities,
                   shower facilities for cyclists and active commuters (run, walk),
                   encourage higher auto occupancy by encouraging carpool networks, such as
                   SmartCommute or Carpool Zone,
                   encourage auto-share, such as ZipCar,
                   increase awareness of alternative transportation modes through education and
                   advertising.

       From the list above, one can see that TDM measures can be physical elements as well as non-
       physical, such operational programs and behavioural characteristics.

       Specifically to the proposed developments, the sites are within walking distance of bus stops (Bus
       Routes 25, 162 and 403) located at the intersection of Don Mills Road and Green Belt Drive /
       Barber Greene Road. Potentially, residents of the developments do not need to own a vehicle for
       transportation ­ they can take transit to work, shopping, and leisure ­ recreation activities.

       The residents can ride-share friends and co-workers or rent a vehicle or belong to an auto-share
       club. The East Site and the West Rental Site will provide two auto-share parking spaces (one for
       each site). The future Condominium Board can also help facilitate carpooling networks by posting a
       sign-up sheet or more formal methods of matching up drivers / passengers.

       The West Rental Site will provide 46 bicycle parking spaces, and the West Condo Site will provide
       18 bicycle parking spaces, which satisfies the City's Draft By-law requirement. The East Site
       provides 180 bicycle parking spaces, which satisfies the City's Draft By-law requirement.

       The following pedestrian facilities should be installed in order to facilitate and encourage safe
       pedestrian movements:
                sidewalks along Green Belt Drive frontage;
                sidewalks along Nob Lane frontage from building entrance to Green Belt Drive;
                crosswalks at Green Belt Drive / Nob Lane with linkages to connect new and existing
                sidewalks and pedestrian accesses to each building;
                provide pedestrian link between east and west condo sites.

       In summary, the possibilities exist to measurably reduce auto-dependency since all or a
       combination of these TDM practices are already proposed and/or easily implemented by the future
       Condo Board. Further, the Don Mills LRT and the Eglinton Crosstown LRT have the potential of
       significantly reducing private / single-vehicle auto-trip volumes for not only the subject site, but more
       importantly for the broader community.

7.   Parking Demand / Supply Review
     7.1      Introduction

     Based on the proposed site plans, the East Site provides 329 parking spaces (including one auto-
     share space) which exceeds the City's Draft By-law requirement (of 276 spaces) by 53 spaces. The
     West Condo Site provides 23 parking spaces for residents, which satisfies the City's Draft By-law
     requirement (the required 5 visitor parking spaces for the West Condo site will be provided in the
     East Site parking facility across Nob Lane).

     The proposed redevelopment for the West Rental Site consisting of a 4-storey building with 61
     rental apartment units, provides a total of 76 parking spaces (including one auto-share space),
     which falls just 3 spaces short of the City's Draft By-Law requirement of 79 parking spaces based
     on the proposed unit breakdown (see Table 8).

                                                           Requirement

     The following is a review of the parking demands at adjacent rental apartment developments with
     similar geographic and developmental characteristics to the proposed West Rental Site. These
     `proxy sites' were used to aid in determine the parking requirements that would be most appropriate
     for the proposed rental apartment. The main objective of the parking review was to determine
     generally whether there is justification for reducing the current calculated parking space
     requirement.


     7.2      Parking Demand Surveys

     GHD surveyed the parking demands of four existing apartment buildings located at near the
     intersection of The Donway East and of Don Mills Road. The survey site locations are illustrated in
     Appendix F.

     To collect reliable tenant parking demands our surveys were undertaken from late afternoon to late
     at night (from 17:00 to 22:00) on January 17, 18, and 19, 2013 (traditionally, the times when most
     residents are home and the highest visitor parking demands are evident). The current occupancy
     data was also obtained from the landowners of the surveyed sites so we could derive a parking



                      GHD | Report for H-M Apartment Moccasin Inc. ­ Transportation Impact and Parking Study | 12253 | 31
       demand rate per occupied dwelling unit (this information was not sensitive to suite size, only
       occupied unit).

       The survey sites include the following four adjacent apartment buildings:

                   o    1053 Don Mills Road Site consisting of 40 dwelling units;
                   o    2 The Donway East consisting of 40 dwelling units;
                   o    4 The Donway East consisting of 40 dwelling units;
                   o    6 The Donway East consisting of 40 dwelling units.

       For our study purpose and our observations, all four buildings `unofficially' share the outdoor parking
       spaces, while they all have a series of carports available (for residents only).

       According to the current occupancy data, at the time of our surveys the 160 units were all occupied.
       There are total of 181 parking spaces provided for the survey buildings including 66 single garage
       spaces and 115 outdoor spaces. The parking supply rate was calculated to be approximately 1.13
       spaces/units including the visitor parking spaces (for the purpose of our surveys and study, it was
       not possible to isolate or determine the visitor parking supply or demands ­ no obvious markings
       for visitor parking, generally poor pavement markings, plus a gravel parking area ­ so we have not
       separated these components).

       Based on our parking survey, at the peak demand, 92 outdoor parking spaces were observed
       occupied. Presuming, for a worst case, that all carports were occupied (based on information
       provided by the owners of the buildings), the total peak parking demand was 158 spaces (92
       outdoor spaces + 66 garage spaces). Thus, based on the above, the parking demand rate was 0.99
       spaces per unit (including visitors).

       Table 9 summarizes the parking demand ratios evident from the surveys, and the detail survey
       data are provide in Appendix F.

        Apartment Buildings)



       7.3         Recommended Parking Ratio

       From the data collected, the parking supply rate for The Donway East apartments was 1.13 spaces /
       unit (including visitors), and the peak parking demand rate was 0.99 spaces / unit (including
       visitors).

       As discussed in Section 7.1, the site plan prepared for the West Rental development proposes total
       of 76 parking spaces (1.24 spaces/units including visitors). Based on our proxy parking surveys of
       the rental residential sites, the proposed parking supply of 76 spaces including visitors will be more
       than sufficient to accommodate the overall parking demands of the West Rental Site.

8.   Internal Site Circulation Review

     The site circulation roadways, main vehicular entrance, and the delivery loading area of the
     buildings were subject to an internal circulation review using Auto TURN software.

     Based on the analysis, the proposed internal roadways are sufficient to accommodate circulation
     requirements of the typical service and standard delivery trucks. Figures 10, 11 and 12 show the
     design vehicles used in the Auto TURN analysis and their pathways through the site.

     Further, we have assisted the architect with the parking and travel aisle layout of the underground
     parking garages. The proposed site plan has been reviewed and found acceptable in terms of

9.   Conclusions and Recommendations
       The `subject sites' include east and west redevelopment parcels ­ an East Site and a West
       Site separated by Nob Lane. The proposed redevelopment for the East Site consists of 240
       condominium units. The West Site will comprise of a 4-storey building with 61 rental
       apartment units (West Rental Site), and a 4-storey building with 23 condominium units
       (West Condo Site).

       Access to the East Site redevelopment is proposed via two full-move accesses ­ one to
       Green Belt Drive and one to Nob Lane. Access to the West Site redevelopment is proposed
       via one full-move access connecting to Green Belt Drive. An additional access and service
       road will be provided for the west site connecting Green Belt Drive to Moccasin Trail.

       The subject redevelopments will generate a total of 32 inbound and 133 outbound
       automobile trips during a.m. peak hours, and 85 inbound and 44 outbound automobile trips
       during p.m. peak hours.

       Trips generated by the proposed development were distributed to the roadway system
       using the existing traffic patterns in the area of study. Trips generated by the proposed
       redevelopments were not distributed to the Nob Lane / Moccasin Trail to be cognizant of
       traffic infiltration issues into the neighbourhood to the north.

       Based on consultations with the applicant, the development is expected to be built-out by
       2015. Therefore, for analysis purposes, a 5-year horizon of 2020 was assumed.

       In order to accommodate 2020 future background traffic demands (including trips generated
       by nearby developments) the following improvements are recommended:
            o Constructing an already-funded westbound right turn lane at the Don Mills Road /
                 Green Belt Drive intersection;
            o Adjusting the signal timings at the Don Mills Road / Green Belt Drive intersection.

       Under the total future (2020) traffic conditions, with the implementation of a planned
       westbound right turn lane and the recommended signal timing modifications at the Don Mills
       Road / Green Belt Drive intersection, the proposed redevelopments can be accommodated
       by the abutting street system. No adjacent road network improvements are triggered by the
       proposed redevelopments.

       The proposed site accesses are expected to have very good operational characteristics
       under the future total traffic conditions.

       The East Site provides 329 parking spaces which exceeds the City's draft by-law
       requirement (276 spaces) by 53 spaces. The West Condo Site provides 23 parking spaces
       for residents, which satisfies the City's draft by-law requirement (the City-required 5 visitor
       parking spaces will be provided in the East Site).

       Based on our proxy parking surveys of the rental residential sites, the proposed parking
       supply of 76 spaces will be sufficient to accommodate the overall parking demands of the
       West Rental Site.

       The Circulation Review plan confirms that the proposed internal roadways are sufficient to
       accommodate circulation requirements of the typical service and standard delivery trucks.
       The underground parking areas were reviewed and were found to be acceptable in terms of
       parking space accessibility and general vehicular travel.

NOTE

*NBLA callable 06:30-10:00 & 15:00-19:00, M-F. SBLA callable 06:30-10:00, M-F, Unused time allocated to NSG.
EW phase is callable by vehicle and / or pedestrian actuations. If a vehicle call is received, the minimum EWG is 9 secs.
If ongoing vehicle demand exists on the stopbar loop, the EWG is capable of providing vehicle extensions up to a maximum of 37 secs. If a pedestrian call is received,
the maximum extensions are served. The EWWK & EWFD are only displayed on the pedestrian signal heads if a pedestrian call is received.
SCOOT is capable of optmizing the EWG and providing up to maximum of 56/47/56 seconds during AM/OFF/PM period (excluding the local vehical extension
of 18 seconds.)
SCOOT cycle lengths between 32-64 may change by 4 second increments, between 64-128 by 8 second increments and above 128 by 16 second increments.
SCOOT may change the cycle length by one increment at a time every 150 seconds.
